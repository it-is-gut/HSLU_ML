"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.",St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore)
"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity.

"As with many of the Erath 2010 vineyard designates, this is strongly herbal. The notes of leaf and herb create somewhat unripe flavor impressions, with a touch of bitterness on the finish. The fruit just passes the ripeness of sweet tomatoes.",Erath 2010 Hyland Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"White flower, lychee and apple aromas carry the mellow bouquet. The chunky-feeling palate bears powdery, sweet flavors of peach and melon, mixed with greener notes of grass and lime.

"This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness.

Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.",Matrix 2007 Stuhlmuller Vineyard Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.",Mauritson 2007 Rockpile Cemetary Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.",Henry's Drive Vignerons 2006 Parson's Flat Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Padthaway)
"This sophisticated wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, which accounts for the firm tannins and dense structure as well as most of the blackberries and blackcurrants. Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.",Silverado 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.",Le Riche 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Mid-gold color. Pronounced and enticing aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, layered with honey and floral notes with a touch of sweet spice. Rich and creamy texture packed with sweet ripe juicy fruit, honey, spice and a twist of sage. Off-dry, deliciously smooth with fresh acidity and medium-body. An elegant wine with a long, creamy, spicy finish.",Pierre Sparr 2007 Vendages Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Attractive mid-gold color with intense aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, strong minerality and hints of spice. Racy with crisp acidity, juicy, rich and smooth texture with lots of concentrated, bright flavors of blood orange, peach, apricot, mango and spice. Strong minerality follows through to a long, precise, juicy finish.",Pierre Sparr 2008 Alsace One White (Alsace)
"Compelling minerality on the nose, Refined and focused floral aromas with ample ripe stone fruit and a hint of petrol. Racy acidity and lovely taut palate with generous layers of juicy ripe peach, apricot and nectarine.  Strong minerality prevails across the palate leading to a lingering finish. Very balanced.",Kuentz-Bas 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A big, black bruiser of a wine that has black olive flavors and aromas and plenty beyond. Raspberry, mulberry, vanilla and spice all vie on the nose, while the palate is so dark it´s tough to discern the plum and leather flavors. Give it three years and reap the benefits.",Camberley 2004 Philosophers' Stone Red (Stellenbosch)
"At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.",Ceretto 2003 Bricco Rocche Brunate  (Barolo)
"Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality. Intense flavors of honey, tangy orange citrus, sweet peach and apricot that are both rich and juicy.  Crisp acidity provides a perfect balance for the slight sweetness on the finish. Taut and focused.",Dopff & Irion 2008 Gentil White (Alsace)
"A Cabernet-dominated (98%) wine, which boasts a dense, concentrated tannic structure. Flavors of cassis underly this, while the wood spices contribute their ribbon of flavor. This is an impressive wine, the flagship red from this estate founded by Spatz Sperling over 30 years ago.",Delheim 2001 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
"Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish.",Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2003  Barolo
"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.",Clark-Clauden 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The color is just beginning to show signs of browning at the edge, but the wine is still fresh and vibrant. The nose is complex, showing licorice, summer fruits, caramel and roses. On the palate, it is soft and pleasant, but lacks some concentration.  At its peak, but will drink well for a few years.",Giacomo Ascheri 2001 Sorano  (Barolo)
"This wine's black cherry and plum flavors veer dangerously toward prune—no doubt a product of the exceedingly hot summer. It's creamy and supple in texture, adding just enough tobacco, vanilla and smoke for complexity. But for all the fruit and ripeness, it finishes with great elegance and precision. Drink now–2020. Imported by Acadia Imports.",Lassègue 2003  Saint-Émilion
"This is great Chenin Blanc, wood fermented but still leaving all the varietal character. Rich, creamy, almond flavors and silky smooth, which keeps all the essential acidity of the grape, with added spice and vanilla.",Beaumont 2005 Hope Marguerite Chenin Blanc (Walker Bay)
"Mid-gold color. Very mineral driven with subtle aromas of bruised apple and stone fruit compote. Crisp, fairly taut palate showing strong minerality and ripe flavors of red apple, cantaloupe, sweet nectarine and spice. Taut and precise texture with a long, slightly austere finish.",Dopff & Irion 2008 Crustacés White (Alsace)
"Beautiful deep gold color. Intense, concentrated nose with vibrant aromas of honey, citrus marmalade and savory botrytis notes. Deliciously sweet and succulent, yet balanced by good acidity.  Packed with flavors of sweet ultra-ripe stone and tropical fruit, with honey and botrytis notes following through. Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish.",Kuentz-Bas 2007 Cuvée Jerémy Sélection de Grains Nobles Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A big, fat, luscious wine with plenty of toasty oak, dark jammy fruit and spices. The palate showed the same lushness; with the fruit front and center with surprising length.  A delicious, rather hefty effort short on finesse but long on flavor.",Poderi Colla 2005 Costa Bruna  (Barbera d'Alba)
"This is one of the more complex wines from the 2003 vintage. The nose has aromas of blackberry liquer, smoked meat, truffle and road tar. On the palate the fruit seems a little heavier and more roasted, but still melds well with its earthy, mushroomy flavors. Medium finish.",Giacomo Ascheri 2003 Vigna dei Pola  (Barolo)
"A beautiful wine, sleek, crisp and ultra-dry, with the most refined flavors of petrol, white peach, kaffir lime, apricot skin and minerals. The acidity is very high and palate-cleansing. The wine was half fermented in barrels, half in stainless steel. Sommeliers, buy this by the case, if you can find it.",Banyan 2007 Riesling (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Rich gold in color. Broad, layered aromas of very ripe fruit with hints of sweet smoke, brown sugar, honey and a savory earthy minerality. Full-bodied, bone dry, but richly textured with crisp acidity and a wide palette of flavors, ripe stone fruit, a creamy savory earthiness, sage and a balsamic kick on the finish. Very long length, slightly warm but with a lingering savory, mineral finish.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Hunawihr Clos Windsbuhl Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Thick and brooding, this dark, sweetly tannic wine also offers higher-toned elements of cedar, dried herb and graphite. It finds its balance amid a full-bodied density of fruit concentration and girth of structure. Drink now through 2023.",Terra Valentine 2013 K Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Cooked cranberry is spiced with anise, peppercorn and roasted beef slices on this bottling from a vineyard planted by three brothers who are longtime Salinas Valley farmers. The palate shows dark cranberry and raspberry, spiced up by chopped sage, thyme and bay leaf.",Testarossa 2013 Guidotti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas. The palate blends a gamy beef quality with oregano, marjoram, cooked strawberry, baked blackberry and a sesame-oil character.",Vincent Vineyards 2010 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.",Vincent Vineyards 2012 Family Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Crisp, pristine peach and apricot notes resonate through the nose and palate of this fresh, blossomy dry Riesling. While zesty and lithe in body, ripe grapefruit and melon flavors feel supple and silky on the palate. Drink now through 2019.",Weingut Liebfrauenstift 2014 Dry Riesling (Rheinhessen)

There's great depth in both body and flavors once sipped, with a layer of fine-grained tannins revealing teriyaki, black plum, boysenberry and touches of lavender.",Wrath 2013 Destruction Level Red (Monterey)
"This wine shows off Yountville fruit at its finest, starting with a floral component to the nose. Spicy, bright and lifted, it coats the palate in ripe berry and cherry, ending with a snap of vanilla.",Yardstick 2013 Ruth's Reach Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This bottling shows a rich, wood-aged wine, full of ripe yellow and tropical fruits as well as rich toasty flavors. The wine is warm, rounded, spicy and with its impressive structure still developing, it has the potential to age well. The wine is named to celebrate the second Lança generation in charge at the estate. Drink from 2017.",Herdade Grande 2014 Gerações Colheita Seleccionada Branco White (Alentejano)
"From a promising new project, the nose of this wine is linear and focused, with black raspberry, black licorice, cola, wet sagebrush and rain-on-slate scents. The tactile acidity once sipped creates a fascinating soft buzz on the tongue, with flavors of dried mint, brisk raspberry and cherry tomato. Camphor and eucalyptus add intrigue on the finish.",Albatross Ridge 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley)
"Dark and thick in the glass, this wine shows strong but not bitter tar notes on the nose plus charred beef in a blueberry glaze, wet campfire, bourbon barrel and vanilla. The structure is massive now, gooey with thick tannins and flavors of espresso bean and condensed purple flowers. Judicious acidity ensures strong cellaring potential. Drink 2018–2027.",Alta Colina 2012 Old 900 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020.",Marques de Griñon 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Graciano (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.",Big Basin 2013 Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.",Carl Graff 2014 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"From an estate in the south of the Alentejo, this is a rich, hot-country wine. It is firm, densely structured and with solid, dark tannins. There is a juicy black fruit background to this dense wine that gives a lift. Still young, this dark and very concentrated wine will be better from 2018.",Casa Santa Vitória 2013 Grande Reserva Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"Baked plum, Asian spice, vanilla and menthol aromas carry the nose. The elegantly structured palate offers fleshy black cherry, licorice, mint and well-integrated French oak alongside fine-grained tannins that lend firm, polished support. A coffee note marks the finish.",Castello di Gabbiano 2012 Bellezza Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)

Drink from 2018 through 2025.",Castello Romitorio 2011 Filo di Seta  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Low-yield vines on the best parcels of the Vincens estate are the source of this wine. It is super-rich and concentrated, maybe too much in its opulent excess. The wine does have great plum and berry flavors that are generous and full in the mouth. The wine even now is still young and will be better from 2018.",Château Vincens 2012 Malbec (Cahors)
"A hearty blend of 76% Zinfandel and 24% Petite Sirah, this bottling packs a wallop of cinnamon-stick on the nose as well as strawberry puree, licorice and black pepper. Clove, allspice, and nutmeg arise immediately on the sip, backed by baked plum and bay leaf notes.",Chronic Cellars 2013 Mr. Nibbles Red (Paso Robles)
"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.",Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Claiborne Vineyard Riesling (Edna Valley)
"Produced from vineyards donated to a charitable hospital in the 19th century, this wine is rich and now perfectly mature. It has smoky tannins that lie under the fine, elegant cherry and red plum fruits and acidity. The wine still has freshness although the attraction here is the ripe structure. The ornate label dates back to 1926.",Collin-Bourisset 2011 Hospices Civils de Romanèche Thurins  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.",Conde de Velázquez 2012 Condesa Real Premium Blend Red (Aconcagua Valley)
"Dry, briary aromas of field brush, black olive, herbs, berry fruits and saucy tomato are textbook Maipo. This is fresh, a touch choppy, and not overly heavy. Flavors of cassis, plum and vanilla carry over to the finish, which is fresh and bolstered by fine natural acidity. Drink through 2022.",Cono Sur 2012 20 Barrels Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Of course, this 90% Tannat wine is still very young. But it's impressive, rich and concentrated and promises to age well. It is dense with both tannins and fruit, black plum and berry flavors dominating, cut by acidity. It will be ready to drink from 2019.",Domaine Berthoumieu 2013 Charles de Batz Tannat-Cabernet (Madiran)
"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.",Dracaena 2013 Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food.

"This wine is put together from multiple vineyard sources, including the well-known Morelli Lane and Widdoes, all farmed by the Duttons. Larger in production than many of the vineyard-designates, it offers baked bread and juicy overtones of cranberry-raspberry layered atop luxuriously toasted oak. It'll show well at the table.",Dutton-Goldfield 2014 Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Fresh and fragrant of blossoms, tart yellow peach and apricot, this off-dry Riesling maintains a crystalline fruit purity that persists throughout Fritz Haag's wines. It's invigorating and irresistably quaffable. The long, melon-rind finish is lip smacking.",Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Feinherb Riesling (Mosel)
"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years.",Fritz Haag 2014 Riesling (Mosel)
"Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy.

"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors. It's plump and round, yet finishes fresh. Good as an apéritif or with light dishes.",Stoneleigh 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Crisp and fresh with enduring aromas of tomato leaf, citrus, pink grapefruit and white stone, this is textbook Sauvignon from the mountainous Alto Adige region of Italy. Pair it with appetizers or lightly spicy foods.",Tenuta Peter Sölva & Söhne 2007 De Silva Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.",TerraMater 2006 Unusual Cabernet-Shiraz-Zinfandel Red (Maipo Valley)
"This Chianti Classico strikes a beautiful balance between elegance and intensity. It has both and its pretty aromas of wild berry, rose, ginger, anise and spice come forth in a continuous, steady manner. It feels bright and lively in the mouth and ends with a touch of piquant spice.",Isole e Olena 2005  Chianti Classico
"Black as a moonless night, dense in structure, tannic, bone dry and super-peppery, this Syrah isn't offering much relief right now. In all likelihood it will emerge from its cocoon in a few years to offer a wealth of ripe blackberry, currant and carob fruit.",Kenwood 2005 Jack London Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.",La Chablisienne 2006 Les Vénérables Vieilles Vignes  (Chablis)

"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",Alamos 2007 Torrontés (Salta)

"Composed and structured, with its fair share of richness manifested as raisin and molasses. Interestingly, the palate rings with acidity, resulting in a feel that's borderline sharp. But there's enough fruit and heft to balance things out, and the flavors of cherry, blackberry and cola are nice. A good example of elevated Carmenère (with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.",Apaltagua 2007 Envero Gran Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a very rich Pinot whose primary virtue is fruit. It just explodes with delicious cherry jam, red currant, licorice and mocha flavors. Dry and crisply acidic, it's a beautiful wine for early drinking.",Harrington 2006 Wiley Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This is a luminous, mature red wine with thick concentration and huge—almost too much—emphasis on toasted oak. Aromas recall vanilla, spice and coffee, although you will find blueberry and cherry on the finish: It is a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2003 Montenero Red (Sicilia)
"Bisquertt usually does well with its value-priced Merlots, and seeing that 2007 was an excellent vintage in Chile, this wine excels in the value price range. The nose is dark and saturated, but pure and inviting. And the palate is ripe and smooth, with spice, plum, blackberry and herb notes, particularly anise. Finishes clean, smooth and peppery. Drink now.",Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa La Joya Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley)

"Black-skinned berry, pipe tobacco and Mediterranean herb aromas waft out of the glass and carry over to the firm linear palate along with morello cherry, licorice and a hint of clove. Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025.",Podere Scopetone 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red (Beira Atlantico)
"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",Robert Mondavi 2015 Fumé Blanc (Napa Valley)
"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.",Samuel Tinon 2015 Megyer Dry Furmint (Tokaj)
"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",Sixteen by Twenty 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.",St. Pauls 2014 Passion Riserva Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.",Talenti 2011 Trentennale  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Bright and creamy, this savory white offers aromas and flavors of ripe apple, Bartlett pear, Alpine herb and a citrus note. Fresh acidity and a mineral vein energize the finish.",Terlan 2015 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.",Mendel 2014 Lunta Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.",Oldenburg 2014 Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",Treleaven 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling (Cayuga Lake)
"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red (Napa Valley)
"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda (Mendoza)
Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz (South Australia)
"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosé eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.",Talamonti 2007 Cerasuolo Rosè  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",Testarossa 2006 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights. It has a very fragrant nose and offers honey, peach and soapy floral notes. In the mouth, the wine delivers sweet fruit and a soft, silky texture.",Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino NV Moscato (San Marino)
"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.",D'Arenberg 2006 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.",Dogwood 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino)
"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Ugni Blanc-Colombard (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",Falcor 2005 Sangiovese (Napa Valley)
"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.",Hayman & Hill 2007 Reserve Selection Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. Though an earlier release might have allowed more primary fruit to show through, the wine offers easygoing but elegant enjoyment.",Hermann J. Wiemer 2002 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.",J. & F. Lurton 2007 Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",Finca Las Moras 2007 Reserve Chardonnay (San Juan)
"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.",Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",Work 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Mountain)
"This seems as if it was assembled from lesser barrels. It's pleasant, very light, simple and tart; the dominant flavor is cranberry juice.",Amity 2006 Estate Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.",Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Monticello)
"Ripe, soft and a little sweet, with jellied flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise. Drink now.",Blue Rock 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.",Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.",Cloud 9 2006 Seity Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",Cueva de las Manos 2007 Reserve Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.",David Fulton 2008 Petite Sirah (St. Helena)
"Esterlina's Pinot is very perfumey, light in body and soul at first, as it gathers steam with a tasty backbone of lush red fruit, spice and plenty of staying power over a meal.",Esterlina 2009 Reserva Pinot Noir (Cole Ranch)
"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry. Fine, dusty tannins reminiscent of cocoa powder and dried crushed berries stay after swallow alongside a hint of sweet smoke flavor.",Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier (Coastal Region)
"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",Graham Beck 2007 The William Red (Coastal Region)
"This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla. Rich blackberry and cassis flavors flood the palate, but then transition to sweet smoke and oak flavors on the finish.",Hartenberg 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors. There is a herbal character as well as dark plum and sweet fruit flavors. Age for 2–3 years, the wine will always be firm.",Vignobles 46N118 2007 Noir 46 Malbec (Cahors)
"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari. It has the heft and polish to open up further with some additional bottle age, but it isn't budging at the moment.",Willamette Valley Vineyards 2009 Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas. Feels a bit clampy and tannic, with oaky, herbal flavors of plum and sweet berry. Shows a hint of green and drying tannins on the finish.",Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red
"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.",Beaver Creek 2008 Fairytale Red (Napa Valley)
"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins. It's on the forward side, trading complexity and nuance in favor of immediate gratification. Drink now–2014.",Byron 2009 Monument Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat. Medium weight and lush, the creamy mouth transitions into a finish loaded with sweet spice and bittersweet cocoa.",Jardin 2007 Syrah (Stellenbosch)
"Fairly intense and flavorful, this Chard expresses assertive aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, buttercream frosting, lemon custard and toasted brioche. Medium weight in the mouth with good balance and a touch of baking spice on the close.",Jardin 2009 Nine Yards Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.",Kaiken 2008 Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot Red (Mendoza)
"This vineyard-designate blend of Trebbiano and Grechetto opens with a luminous golden color and elegant aromas of stone fruit, citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mature pear. There's a pretty hint of vanilla and almond butter at the back.",Lungarotti 2007 Torre di Giano Vigna il Pino White (Torgiano)
"This sophisticated white wine from the homeland of Italy's most robust reds (Ripasso and Amarone) shows a full, generous appearance with a golden-amber color. Stone fruit, toasted almond and candied lemon give it heft and consistency.",Marchesi Fumanelli 2005 Terso White (Veneto)
"Smooth and ripe, this is a rich black-fruited wine, its tannins comfortably ensconsed in a rich cushion. There is acidity to balance and spice which, along with the full-bodied fruit character, makes the wine ready to drink now.",Mariell 2009 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg)
"A gorgeous expression of Friulano, this wine (in a screwcap bottle) makes an elegant addition to chicken, pasta or seafood dinners. Layers of peach, almond and pineapple are wrapped tightly together.",Livio Felluga 2009 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Lively aromas of lemon, grapefruit and melon start this white from Greece. Flavors of grapefruit and lemon rind are fresh and crisp but still offer dimension. The finish is spicy and clean. A great food wine: pair with grilled fish or clams.",My Big Fat Greek Wine 2010 Assyrtico (Santorini)
"This partially oak-aged expression of Pinot Bianco from cool-climate Alto Adige (in the far north of Italy) offers a lovely texture that is creamy and smooth at the same time. Measured aromas include melon, apricot, grapefruit and a touch of vanilla spice.",Nals Margreid 2010 Sirmian Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.",O. Fournier 2007 B Crux Red (Uco Valley)
"This is a gorgeous Italian white from northern Italy that boasts fragrant tones of spring flower and chopped herb backed by peach, honey and white almond. It's crisp, intense and would be perfect with basil Thai curry.",Pico Maccario 2010 Estrosa White (Monferrato)
"A medium-weight Cabernet with plum, prune, tobacco and herb aromas. Features average weight and body, with a creamy texture and layered flavors of black fruit, raspberry and spice. Finishes with herb and plum notes as well as a pinch of tobacco.",Sottano 2009 Reserva de Familia Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"A huge, kick butt Zinfandel, packed with sweet berry, bacon, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors. There's absolutely nothing shy about it. Packs a real punch all the way through to the spicy finish. Good price for a Sonoma Zin this classic.",St. Francis 2009 Old Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.",Trailhead 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Fruity, forward and quite refreshing, this has appealing black cherry fruit with a light candy flavor. The balancing tannins add sufficient depth and weight to allow this a few more years in the cellar.",Erath 2009 Bishop Creek Pinot Noir
"This oak-fermented Sauvignon (in an artsy, screwcap bottle) delivers a rich, spicy finish and thick layers of peach, citrus, tomato leaf and honey-like aromas. It's a gorgeous wine that is an absolute pleasure to drink.",Franz Haas 2009 Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"A strongly spicy, rich wine, this has great concentration and an intense, dense texture.There is weight with plenty of ripe tropical fruits to contrast pronounced black pepper and bitter almond character. It's still young, so don't drink before 2015. Screwcap.",Forstreiter 2012 Schiefer Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This is another fine Pinot from Cambria, showing the winery's great price-quality ratio. Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices. It's bone dry, and also quite tannic, but you can enjoy it now with big, rich lamb and beef dishes, or a wild mushroom risotto. Otherwise, it will continue to improve for at least eight years.",Cambria 2011 Bench Break Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015–2024.",I Giusti e Zanza 2009 Dulcamara Red (Toscana)
"Bella Vida replaces the Abbey Ridge bottling and does so with pizzazz. The best of the 2011 releases, this is a beautiful expression of grapes grown on red clay soils, with refined, deeply penetrating flavors of ripe raspberries. Smooth, supple and long, with uncommon purity, it finishes with a kiss of chocolate from 18 months in one-quarter new oak barrels.",J. Christopher 2011 Bella Vida Vineyard Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.",Viña Cobos 2011 Marchiori Vineyard Block C2 Malbec (Perdriel)
"This is a very aromatic wine that's rich, spicy and with just a touch of ripeness. It has spiced pear, lychee and honey notes all balanced by a wonderful fresh acidity. Drink now and until 2020. Screwcap.",Salomon-Undhof 2011 Steiner Kögl Erste Lage Riesling (Kremstal)
"While delicious now with flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and oak, all showered with tart, citrusy acidity, this wine also has a great future. Give it 6–8 years to evolve in the bottle for further complexity.",Talley 2011 Rincon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This is the stud in the Acústic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Braó is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.",Acústic 2010 Braó Vinyes Velles Carignan-Grenache (Montsant)
"While it feels rich and round, this is also a wine with a crisp side to it. Acidity cuts through ripe pear, apricot and lychee flavors, giving a decidedly crisp balance. It's a wine that is already ready to drink. Screwcap.",Josef Schmid 2011 Kremser Gebling Erste Lage Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is so rich and decadent, with milk chocolate, blackberry and new French oak flavors. Made by celebrity winemaker Philippe Melka, it's soft and approacheable on the palate and widely appealing. Your best bet is to drink up now.",Parallel 2010 Fortune Teller Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a wine that has great potential—you can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture. Initially, black currant flavors are touched with dark, dusty notes, but they finish with more juicy character on the afterntaste. Drink from 2017.",Château Lafon-Rochet 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"This powerful Sagrantino opens with aromas of meat juice, truffle and black fruit. The palate offers blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon and black pepper, along with tobacco notes. It also has Sagrantino's trademark tannic backbone, but the tannins are ripe and are balanced by bright acidity.",Dionigi 2006  Sagrantino di Montefalco
"Rich almonds, ripe peaches and a smoky, oxidized character all come together in this ripe, complex, fascinating wine. There is a great tang of apple acidity on the finish. Drink now.",Domaine Daniel Dugois 2006 Vin Jaune Savagnin (Arbois)
"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.",Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.",Finca Sophenia 2011 Synthesis Malbec (Tupungato)

"Foresty and dark on the bouquet, with aromas of licorice, prune, forest and foxiness.

"Soft, light in body and easy to drink, this Sangiovese, from the Napa estate vineyard, is delicious in raspberry, red currant, licorice, bacon and spice flavors. It's somewhat ephemeral, an instantly pleasant wine to drink especially with cured meats, olives, hard cheeses.",Benessere 2007 Estate Sangiovese (Napa Valley)
"A good, clean, tart and lightly spicy all-stainless style. Cool climate fruit puts the accent on lime and lemon flavors, keeps the alcohol low (13.3%), and makes this a fine match to shellfish, white fish and light pasta dishes.",Buried Cane 2009 Whiteline No Oak Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This fresh Nebbiolo-based Roero from Cantina dei Nebbiolo offers pretty intensity with aromas of tar, licorice and a touch of sweet cherry liqueur. There isn't much pulp or meat here but the finish is both crisp and tart.",Cantina del Nebbiolo 2008  Roero

This aged expression from the Nizza subzone of Asti offers tertiary aromas of dried tobacco and dried prune. The variety's characteristic acidity kicks in on the finish.,Cascina La Ghersa 2004 Vignassa  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore Nizza)
"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.",Claudia Springs 2007 Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
"Fragrant on the nose with fresh orange, lemon and honeysuckle aromas, this full-bodied Chard is deliciously quaffable with a concentrated apple palate and just a hint of buttered toast. Another well-made Romanian at an unbeatable bargain price.",Cramele Recas 2009 Chardonnay (Recas)

"Aged 12 months in large oak casks, this bright Nebbiolo offers pretty aromas of small berry, tar, licorice and cigar smoke backed by tight intensity and structure. Pair this powerful wine with braised quail or pork tenderloin.",Boffa 2006 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"This wine is light in color, but still packs a mouthful of flavor. It's peppery and meaty upfront, filled out on the midpalate by tart fruit that verges on cranberry in flavor. Pretty rather than potent; drink now-2014.",Otto's Constant Dream 2008 Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
"A good wine to drink now for its sweet, ripe berry and mocha flavors and smoky coat of oak. It has smooth tannins and a spicy finish. Give it a good decant to let it breathe for a few hours.",Mount Veeder 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Roero Rabino is accented by sweet touches of cinnamon and nutmeg that are offset by cassis, dried blueberry, leather and tobacco. This sturdy red wine presents a very nice ensemble that is capped by a tight, astringent close.",Rabino 2008  Roero
"With rich, sweet blackberry and cocoa flavors, this is a very nice Cabernet for drinking with a good meal. It's a little rough around the edges, with jaggy tannins. Ready now.",Robert Mondavi 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Honey, almond blossom and citrus zest are followed by creamy foam and tonic acidity. This is an easygoing Prosecco that offers a light and compact structure and bright flavors of lime and green fruit.",Bellussi NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)

"Soft, ripe, dominated by peaches, pears and a rounded, toasty character. The spice is dominant, giving the wine an exotic edge. The more rounded style gives concentration as well as a fine, finishing velvet texture.",Château Tour de Mirambeau 2006  Bordeaux Blanc
"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.",Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot (Curicó Valley)
"Paladin produces a luminous and fresh Prosecco from the northeast of Italy with tonic aromas of peach, white stone and citrus fruit. It's an easy-drinking wine that would wash down well with appetizers and informal finger foods.",Paladin 2007 Millesimato Brut Prosecco (Veneto)

This Brut interpretation of Prosecco (“Brut” means it tastes dry in the mouth) offers tangy fizz and soda-like intensity backed by subdued aromas of white mineral and stone fruit. Pair it with puff pastry appetizers.,Sant Eurosia 2007 Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)

"Mildly minty and woody on the nose, with grass, wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby, with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart, decidedly “red” personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish, making it a fresh, lean style of Cabernet.",J. & F. Lurton 2006 Gran Araucano Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
The wine's golden hue tells you this is Prosecco from a warmer climate (Conegliano is a few degrees warmer than Valdobbiadene) as do its aromas of mature peach and honeysuckle. The wine tastes flat and big in the mouth and offers sophisticated notes of white pepper and spice.,L'Antica Quercia 2007 Matiú Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano)
"This white has a light, delicate nose of citrus and apricot. On the palate it's smooth and balanced with lush apricot and spice flavors. A touch of acidity gives the wine lift. A lingering finish adds to its poise. Pair with a creamy cheese or sip alone.",Lucas Vineyards 2007 Vignoles (Finger Lakes)
Drying mineral tones face off with luscious peach flavors to create a well-balanced Extra Dry Prosecco sparkler. The bubbly offers cheerful foaming in the mouth and sweet fruit flavors on the close.,Marsuret NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Opening aromas of vanilla cookie show a resemblance to Animal Crackers, while the palate is more vivacious and tangy, with flavors of orange, tangerine and apple. We wouldn't call this an elegant or refined wine, but we like its no-issues attitude and citrusy content. Probably good with salads and seafood.",De Martino 2007 Legado Reserva Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"This New World blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier is very fruity. It offers a blast of pineapples, honeysuckles, peaches and figs, with a coating of oaky, vanilla buttercream.",Beringer 2007 Alluvium Blanc White (Knights Valley)
"With a fruity-sugary finish, this Zin will appeal to folks who like their red wines a little on the sweet side. It has pleasantly ripe flavors of black cherries, raspberries, red currants, root beer, mocha and pepper.",Brutocao 2006 Reserve Zinfandel (Mendocino)
"This Rhône-style blend is a little rustic and sharp in tannins and acids. It shows a polished core of jammy blackberries, cherries and spices, and could develop in a year or two.",Clos La Chance 2006 Lila's Cuvée Red (Central Coast)
"Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gewürztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.",Cono Sur 2008 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley)
"This Prosecco Brut from the slightly warmer Conegliano subzone is a perfect example of its kind. The luminous sparkler offers drying mineral tones that are embellished by pretty notes of white rose, honey, stone fruit and citrus. The mouthfeel is lean, smooth and fresh.",Sommariva NV Palazzo Rosso Brut  (Prosecco di Conegliano)
This crisp sparkler is characterized by drying mineral tones and delicate aromas of stone fruit and citrus. The wine is foamy and slightly sweet in the mouth and does an excellent job of representing this category of Italian wine.,Spagnol NV Col del Sas Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A ripe, fruity wine that takes its raspberry flavor from the color. The wine has softness, a creamy character that rounds out any acidity, leaving a smooth, fruity finish.",Jacquart NV Mosaïque Rosé Brut  (Champagne)
"There's a unique note here of mature fruit, chopped basil or peppermint with a hint of spice or chopped white peppercorn. The bubbling seems less frothy and the wine has a flat, big feel in the mouth. Grapes were farmed organically and the wine is from the 2007 vintage, which may explain its distinctive style.",L'Antica Quercia 2007 Arió Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano)
"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate. This tastes of burnt oak, raw plum and currant, while the finish tastes briny and harsh. The 2012 version of this wine was much better. This is rough from front to back.",Koyle 2015 Costa Pinot Noir (Colchagua Costa)
"An easy and inviting selection, there's a mentholated streak to the soft red currant and cherry core of this wine. Light and breezy on the palate, it offers thin, quickly dissipating flavors and a fleeting finish.",Château Notre Dame du Quatourze 2015 Rosé (Languedoc)
The wine is earthy and somewhat rustic. There is fruit but it is spoiled by a spicy pepper edge. Chill this drastically.,Mémoires 2015 Rosé (Coteaux Varois en Provence)
"Red in color, with berry and apple aromas, this is sweet, with a heavy body and light effervescence.",Cavas Hill NV 1887 Rosado Sparkling (Cava)
"The nose is muted, despite the slight spritz of the wine, while the palate is equally toned down. It's a rounded if not very expressive white wine.",Antoine Moltès & Fils 2015 Tradition Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Plummy and hinting at black cherry, this wine is otherwise soft and simple, with a distracting, full-throttled descent into raisin cake and prune.",Pezzi King 2013 Serracino Reserve Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Funky, yeasty aromas of cinnamon, spent lees and bread yeast dominate the nose. This feels foamy, with lightly vegetal flavors of apple that finish briny.",Bellisco NV Sparkling (Cava)

"Aromas of pumpkin, squash and corn chips are stale and not inviting. There's an acceptable mouthfeel to this weird, unbalanced Chardonnay along with flavors of spiced squash, mealy apple and sautéed root vegetables.",Viña Tarapacá 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley)
"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.",Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen)
"This deep brown wine smells like a damp, mossy cave. Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses. It's full, round and harmonious, wonderfully rich yet without any sense of heaviness and long and bright on the finish.",Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscadelle (Rutherglen)
"Dusty, saffron-spiced earthiness is juxtaposed against intense mango and tangerine fruitiness in this deeply complex wine. It's unctuously sweet, but balanced by a piercing streak of acidity that penetrates through the midpalate. Spry and silken, it finishes on a long lingering whisper of honey and peach.",Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Trockenbeerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest. Full, rich and sweet, but surprisingly drinkable, with terrific intensity and length.",Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Grand Muscat (Rutherglen)
"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now–2030.",Torbreck 2012 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa)
"After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry. The juicy concentrated palate dishes out layers of succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and pipe tobacco framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2022–2035.",Cavallotto 2010 Vignolo Riserva  (Barolo)
"This amber-colored Hungarian stunner has ethereal aromas of raw honey, beeswax, freshly baked tarte Tatin, canned apricot and fresh pear. It is silky smooth and creamy in the mouth with pronounced flavors of clover honey, pear tart and baked sweet apples. The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying.",Oremus 2005 Eszencia  (Tokaji)
"Citrus-kissed saltiness lies at the core of this incredibly delicious, deliriously crafted wine, from the great grape grower in the heart of the Russian River Valley. Beautifully crisp, it lingers in stony minerality and a freshness of apricot, memorable from first sip to last.",Rochioli 2014 South River Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This beautiful, rich wine has yellow fruits and is concentrated, tightly textured and conveys a ripe character. The touches of wood are just right, adding spice to the opulent fruitiness. A mineral texture gives some tightness to the aftertaste. Drink from 2024.",Louis Latour 2014 Le Montrachet  (Montrachet)
"Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels. It's honeyed and sweet but vivaciously balanced, glazing the palate in ethereal textures of gossamer and tulle. The caramel finish lingers endlessly.",Robert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gräfenberg Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"A waft of smoky char and toasty oak provide a rich foundation and compelling entry into this one-acre vineyard-designate from the historic grower, before unleashing, slowly, a torrent of melon and fresh-cut apple with a length of intriguing nutmeg and cardamom. Medium-bodied and lush, it will remain on your palate memory a long time.",Rochioli 2014 Sweetwater Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same—dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.",Jasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote)
"Produced from vines more than 100 years old in the heart of the Clos de Vougeot vineyard, this is an impressive wine with a long future. The wood aging is already surrounded by ripe, intense black fruits. A fresher character comes from the bright acidity of the vintage, giving the wine a lift. The aftertaste is long and concentrated. Drink from 2024.",Château de la Tour 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Clos de Vougeot)
"Intensely fragrant, this honey-sweet auslese wafts of ripe yellow peaches and caramelized sugar. Tropical mango, pineapple and melon collide on the palate before falling neatly in line against a strike of high-toned acidity. The finish is luxuriously long, peppered by a faint dusting of saffron. It's a stunner already but should shine brightly for decades to come.",Weingut Hans Bausch 2011 Hattenheimer Hassel Auslese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Up the slope above the Grand Cru of Le Montrachet, this vineyard once grew hemp (hence the name, cheneve). This poised wine is both stylish and rich, with good acidity allied to ripe apple and citrus fruits, cut through the mineral texture and promise a generous wine as it ages. Drink from 2020.",Philippe Colin 2014 Les Chenevottes Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now–2030.",Torbreck 2012 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)
"Enticing scents of ripe berry, underbrush, grilled herb and eucalyptus mingle together along with an underlying fragrance of rose petal. Elegant and fresh, the impeccably balanced palate delivers tart red cherry, cake spice, white pepper and mineral nuances alongside polished tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",Bel Colle 2012 Simposio  (Barolo)
"As impressive as the woman—a pioneer in the Napa Valley—was herself, this 100% varietal wine from the estate property high atop Diamond Mountain is powerfully elegant, intense yet refined. It begins with a high-toned, graceful entry that's rich in blueberry and chocolate, the oak smooth and integrated, with a suggestion of hand-rolled tobacco. Drink now through 2022.",J. Davies 2012 Jamie Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This is an opulent wine from one of the fabled series of white Grand Crus. Along with generous yellow fruits and ripe citrus, it has weight and gravitas. Spice from the wood fills things out even more, giving the wine its balance, its intensity and its future. Drink from 2022.",Louis Latour 2014  Criots-Bâtard-Montrachet
"For 2014, the Weber is the star of a very fine Winderlea lineup. Dark and deeply concentrated, it's jammed with black cherry fruit, annotated with anise and showing a hint of gunmetal. The tannins are ripe and taste of clean earth. This is a fine candidate for aging. Drink now through 2030.",Winderlea 2014 Weber Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky—full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut—but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now–2025.",Wakefield 2013 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Shiraz (Clare Valley)
"This spends 12 months in oak and it shows: It offers aromas of liquid smoke and flavors of brown sugar, honey and caramel. The fruit is subdued, leaving the emphasis on the oak and mineral components. Try with rich but delicately flavored fish dishes or mild chèvres.",Cantina Terlano 2000 Vorberg Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Aromas of mint, berry syrup and dense, lemony oak lay a good foundation for the heavy black fruit that comes on the palate atop a plush carpet of toasty, fresh-grained wood. The finish is round, tasty and mouthfilling, while overall the wine seems to dance due to popping acidity. This is Carmenère with a vital streak.",De Martino 1999 Reserva de la Familia Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"A plump, juicy mouthful of citrusy fruit, worth trying with grilled or broiled seafood. The zesty lime aromas broaden out on the palate to include orange and tangerine flavors, making it tart but not too tart. Best Buy.",Montresor 2001  Bianco di Custoza
"This medium-weight wine flows effortlessly from start to finish, blending aromas of smoke and nuts with a citrusy core. Picks up savory nutty, cheesy notes (like a good Gruyère) on the long finish.",Ronco del Gelso 1999 Chardonnay (Friuli)
"Mint again, with earth and tobacco; one taster found traces of bell pepper. Coffee and brown sugar further soften a supple, mature mouthfeel. Drink now.",Sebastiani 1991 Cherryblock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Fragrant, aromatic, grassy aromas give way to fresh, crisp, green fruit and gooseberry flavors. Finishes lively and vibrant.",Elena Walch 2002 Castel Ringberg Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige)

"A well-judged, well-structured wine that balances fresh, crisp and light fruit against flavors of peaches, almonds and cinnamon. It will be better in two or three years' time.",Volpe Pasini 2002 Zuc de Volpe Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"A fresh, tangy, vibrant wine that has ripe green plum and apple flavors alongside a layer of full, forward fruit.",Zenato 2001 Vigneto Massoni White (Naoussa)
"The color is appropriately light, the aromas appropriately floral and rose-like. Fleshy cherry flavors are balanced by a helping of greens and flowers. Light and elegant. Who would've thought Nebbiolo like this could come from Mexico?",L.A. Cetto 1996 Private Reserve Nebbiolo (Valle de Guadalupe)
"This blend of Chardonnay, Nosiola and Pinot Bianco offers up apples and cream on the nose, along with flavors of peach and citrus. It's a comfortable mix of fruit that finishes lively and fresh, making it a fine apéritif.",La Vis 2001 Bianco dei Sorni White (Trentino)
"At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.",Lapostolle 2002 Estate Bottled Merlot (Rapel Valley)
It's testament to this wine's balance that it remains so alive and fresh long after many other Biancos have faded. Intensely mineral aromas mix with notes of smoke and fresh apples; the flavors are earthy and hint at mineral oil. Long on the finish. Best Buy.,Fratelli Zeni 2000 Vigne Alte  (Bianco di Custoza)
"With its herbal, traditional aromas, this New World Cabernet could impersonate and Old World model. The palate is tight and firm, with lively tannins and bracing acids. The flavors run toward plum and chocolate, and there's a bitter hint on the back palate. The finish is plummy and dark.",Carmen 2000 Estate Grown Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This lovely Chardonnay has just the right blend of juicy peaches and subtle herbs and flowers to make it easy to drink, yet interesting enough to hold your attention. Finishes long and mouthwatering.",Tommasi 2001 Vigneto Santa Cecilia Chardonnay (Valdadige)
"Aromas of roses, pepper and spices make this an enticing wine. On the palate, it is ripe, soft, full-bodied and rich, lacking acidity, but otherwise classic Gewürztraminer.",San Michele Eppan 2002 Sanct Valentin Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
"Richly textured, viscous but with good acidty for balance. The wine shows pretty melon, citrus, herb, grass, peach and spice flavors and features a mineral edge that is fresh and clean at the end.",Vinoce 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.",Merriam 2000 Windacre Vineyard Merlot (Russian River Valley)
"A great and versatile food wine. Its polished flavors of lime, fig and apricot are drizzled with Oriental spices and smoky oak. One of California's  most consistent wines, and rich enough to stand in for Chardonnay.",Murphy-Goode 2000 Reserve Fume Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)
"Delicate and complex, a cool climate wine with a mixture of ripe cherry flavors and leaner ones of tobacco, tomato skin, and cranberry. Bone dry with excellent acidity, this somewhat tart wine is well made, and may be an ager.",Kynsi 1999 Paragon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"A blend of grapes, so maybe it is not surprising that the aromas and flavors are a blend: melons, pears and limes, all presented with great freshness and verve alongside a rich texture. Editors' Choice.",Cantina Terlano 2002 Terlano Classico White (Alto Adige)
"Right off the bat this wine is pure and smooth. The nose is pretty, with cranberry and cassis. Next up is a palate of pure red fruit and only a light shading of oak. The finish draws applause for its clarity and buttery nuances. It's what a good Chilean Cabernet should be; it's ripe and easy to drink, yet fairly solid and impressive. Best Buy.",Casa Julia 2001 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.",Valdivieso 2001 Reserve Chardonnay (Central Valley)
"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.",Bridlewood 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Strongly oaked, but fresh, young and healthy in the nose. The smell of coconut and lemon curd is friendly and soft, while the palate is loaded with more lemon, coconut, pear and nutmeg. The texture is rich, and, for now, the acidity is bright. A solid Chardonnay for current drinking.",San Pedro 2002 Castillo de Molina Reserva Chardonnay (Lontué Valley)
"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley)
"This is the first vintage of this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc, named after the 16th-century abbess Rylint Formentini.

"Rich in spicy, briary berry-cherry and chocolate fruit, with ultra-smooth tannins, and just enough acidity to cut through barbecue sauce. It's a bit sweet and Porty on its own.",Cline 2007 Ancient Vines Zinfandel (California)
"Fresh aromas of red cherry and light berry fruit precede a palate that runs a little racy, with borderline tart plum and pie cherry flavors. A solid mouthfeel and mild, chalky tannins give it presence, and for sure it's a clean, sturdy wine. But that's really as far as it goes.",Cono Sur 2008 Visión Pinot Noir (Colchagua Valley)
"On the plump but balanced side, with a perfumed nose that's almost sweet for SB. In the mouth, it's fairly lively and lifted, with nectarine and melon flavors that morph into pink grapefruit on the finish. Decent quality; will get the job done.",Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)
"The wine starts off slowly due to a note of almond nut or cardboard that masks the natural fruit. Once it gets started, however, this luminous sparkling Prosecco offers cheerful notes of stone fruit and pear.",Astoria 2008 Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda. There's an interesting touch of crushed white peppercorn in there as well and this well-priced wine would make a perfect match to appetizers and finger foods.",Cantine Maschio NV Brut Prosecco (Italy)

"Formerly doing business as “Shiraz,” this Syrah from Bisquertt offers a huge purple tint, roasted aromas of blackberry and campfire, and a ripe, grapey palate that brims with simple, racy black cherry, pepper and other driving flavors. Not timid by any means but also nothing out of the ordinary.",Viña Bisquertt 2007 Casa la Joya Reserve Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"Dry and acidic, this light-bodied wine has tart flavors of mashed cherries, cherryskins, orange zest and citrus fruits. It's a Bordeaux blend with Zinfandel and Sangiovese. Nice with pizza with prosciutto and olives.",Vinavanti 2005 Le Bon Viveur Red (California)

"Aromas of baked apple, nut oil and toast are mildly appealing, while the round, dry palate is home to flavors of melon and bitter pith.

Ideally, though, think of spicy cuisine like Indian, Thai or Indonesian.",McGregor 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)

"Using many biodynamic practices, Werner Michlits has crafted a rich, sweet and juicy wine, full of intense fruit, touched by spice, but more to do with black plum, fresh figs and vivid acidity. This is a hearty wine, ready to drink, its final tannins soft. Screwcap.",Michlits 2007 Biokult Zweigelt Pinot Noir Red (Burgenland)
"A smooth, perfumed wine that has softened just in time for its fifth year. It has black-currant and berry fruits that are ripe while still showing fresh acidity. The tannic structure is there, well integrated into the polished structure. Drinkable now.",Château de Callac 2011  Graves
"This is the first of 15 estates the Gonfrier family owns throughout Bordeaux. There are strong wood influences here, although the fruit is enough to match up. So ripe pear and apricot flavors go with those toasty characters to give a rich, full-bodied wine. It will be better from late 2016.",Château de Marsan 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree. The aromas are quite reserved, with notes of barrel spice that are followed by full-bodied fruit flavors with a spicy finish. It drinks well but the variety seems lost.",Guardian 2013 Confidential Source Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Slightly foxy on the nose, with rubbery aromas of cherry and cassis, this offers a tight, tannic palate with hard, elastic tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis are pleasant, while the finish is ripe, warming and healthy.",Luberri 2011 Seis  (Rioja)
"A touch blossomy against a core of ripe raspberry and cherry perfume, the nose on this traditional-method Pinot Noir sparkler is particularly alluring. The palate is elegant and fresh, marked by fine, mouthfilling mousse and delicate raspberry-candy finish.",Macari 2010 Cuvée Gabriella Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island)
"An earthy hint colors the pear notes which on the palate acquire a fresh, almost floral quality. The earthy tone of yeast and miso provides a counterpoint to the zesty, lime-peel freshness. The finish is clean-cut and very refreshing.",Malat 2015 Crazy Creatures Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)

"Creamy notes pear crumble make for a most attractive nose. The palate follows with gentle softness and concentration, supported by bright, fresh acidity.

The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers.",Walla Walla Vintners 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))

"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage.",Robert Mondavi 2011 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)

It's smooth and rich with enough freshness to make this a perfect match for seasoned cheeses or roasted red meat.",Valentina Cubi 2008 Morar  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"Crisp and structured, this is an intensely mineral wine. It has great acidity and a strongly zesty, tangy character that still needs time to soften.

"Dense, dark and spicy, this opens with a thicket of briar and bramble—one almost wants to say thistle—wrapped around taut, compact black fruits. There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.",Domaine Serene 2010 Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"The nose of this powerfully fruity yet dry Riesling packs a punch, with aromas of ripe pineapple, apricot and floral potpourri.

"This wine is ripe, rich and full in the mouth, like a fruit salad of red cherries, plums and berries.

Drink from 2017.",Henri de Villamont 2010 Les Feusselottes Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny)
"A powerful wine, richly structured and full of ripe fruits. It has a solid feel to it, firmly anchored to its dark tannins as well as lightened by the juicy berry flavors.

"Already mature, this is a rich and opulent wine that blends together toast and secondary-fruit aromas with fresh, lively acidity. It has weight and substantial depth and concentration.

"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon was grown in the well-known Beckstoffer Georges III Vineyard. It's at a funny stage of development, with primary cherry and blackberry fruit starting to fade, while sage, dill, green olive and dried fruit notes are emerging. The tannins remain robust, while the acidity is just about perfect for Napa Valley. Awkward now, but with a promising future, it should emerge from the doldrums after 2017.",Bell 2009 Clone 6 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still. The blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese, putting it in the super Tuscan category. Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025.",Castello di Amorosa 2009 La Castellana Red (Napa Valley)
"An interesting percentage of Cabernet Franc gives this wine a more perfumed character than is usual in many Pomerols. On the palate, the wine is rich and shows the aromatic character of the berry fruits and well integrated wood. It is young still, needing time. Drink from 2017.",Château Vray Croix de Gay 2010  Pomerol
"This is a superior vintage Champagne that is just beginning to mature. Crisp white and citrus fruits are beginning to fade into mature toast and cookie flavors, but the wine maintains its zesty texture. Drink this wine now, but beware the cork is secured precariously with string that must be cut to open.",Dampierre 2005 Grand Cru Family Reserve Brut  (Champagne)

"This Stella Mae is 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. It remains a rather lean wine in the Sparkman portfolio, despite having alcohol at 14.6%. Here are lightly earthy flavors of strawberry and herb, with a hint of green in the tannins.",Sparkman 2009 Stella Mae Red (Red Mountain)
"This pretty Cannonau-based wine opens with ripe aromas of blackberry, tobacco and dried spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, plush and dense.",Argiolas 2008 Costera Cannonau (Isola dei Nuraghi)

"This smooth, lush Cabernet is brimming with blackberry, black currant, blueberry cedar and spice flavors. It's classic Cabernet. You'll find quite a scour of acidity running through the middle, which suggests this wine should pair with rich, fatty meats.",Lyeth 2010 L de Lyeth Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)

"This bright white is redolent of tomato leaf, wild salvia and citrus. The brightness of the bouquet is followed by a satisfyingly creamy mouthfeel.",Vigneti Le Monde 2010 Sauvignon (Friuli Grave)
"Lime, apple and mineral aromas come with a note of eggy yeast. The mouthfeel is regular and a touch foamy, with semisweet flavors of kiwi, apple and gooseberry. Mild and feeling good on the finish, it's basic but well worth a go.",V&N; Cellars NV Reserva Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"This is a soft, creamed-apple style of wine, with a great shaft of acidity cutting through the crisp fruit. Kiwi and gooseberry fruits are lifted on the bright, lively finish.",Winzer Krems 2011 Kellermeister Privat Goldberg Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.",Zerba Cellars 2008 Sangiovese (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Produced by Three Rivers for celebrity winemaker Geoff Tate, the Insania is actually rather tame. Pretty fruit flavors of berry, cherry and plum introduce the wine gracefully, then run into some stiff, drying, chalky tannins.",Insania 2009 Red (Red Mountain)
"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.",Knapp 2011 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish. This should pair with a range of midweek dinners.",Lava Cap 2010 Battonage Chardonnay (El Dorado)
"This barrel-fermented Verdejo is interesting, but it's also a bit low on acidity. It smells like pine and blowsy flowers. Creamy, soft and cuddly on the palate, this has flavors of baked apple, wood resin and banana. It finishes round and sweet. Drink now.",Loess 2009 Collection Blanco Verdejo (Rueda)

"Full and smoky, with bacon, blackberry and tire rubber on the nose. This is a bit grating in feel due to full tannins and acids, with wild berry flavors, bitter oak, black plum and darkness. Lengthy on the finish.",Aleo 2009 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"A blend of 70% Pinot Grigio and 30% Ribolla Gialla, this bright white opens with floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle, white pepper and stone fruit. The Ribolla Gialla element adds structure and notes of caramel and pineapple.",Altùris 2011 White (Venezia Giulia)
"Medium bodied, this sharply defined wine brings in plenty of notes of herb, root and earth around its light berry fruit. It captures the defining flavors of Wahluke Slope Syrah in a somewhat muted style, reflecting the abbreviated growing season.",Camaraderie 2009 Clifton Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope)
"This is a mix of fruit from both warm and cool vineyards, crafting a clean, fresh, lightly herbal wine with a pleasing dusty character. Hints of cocoa and toast annotate the tart berry fruit, with a thread of smoke and chalk running through the tannins.",Camaraderie 2009 Tempranillo (Yakima Valley)
"This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.",Beringer 2014 Quantum Red (Napa Valley)

Tangy smoked tangerine flavors show on the energized sip, where a unique sandalwood smoky quality plays with more cider-like tang.",Big Basin 2014 Coastview Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey County)

Flavors of coffee, chocolate and lemon peel precede a toasty finish that overflows with chocolaty oak and lingering tannins. Drink through 2023.",Cono Sur 2012 20 Barrels Limited Edition Peralillo Estate Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"Delicate in cranberry and strawberry, this wine is highlighted in uplifted acidity and plenty of length and breadth within its medium-bodied structure. A pleasing streak of cardamom is consistent throughout, as accents of forest floor and cola figure in.",D.R. Stephens 2014 Silver Eagle Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

"From a walled vineyard once owned by the local bishop, this wine is structured and firm while also having great red cherry and berry fruit.

Effusive aromas of blueberry and black cherry lead to opulent but not overripe berry flavors that are lightly accented by clove and cinnamon nuances.",Prospect 772 2014 The Brat Grenache (Calaveras County)
"Bob Lindquist is almost certainly the only vintner in America that is drying Marsanne on straw mats to make a dessert wine. The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors. Fascinating stuff.",Qupé 2013 Doux Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Marsanne (Edna Valley)
"This is a delicate yet flavorful take on this grape, from a biodynamic, cool-climate vineyard. Light red plum and hibiscus aromas meet with sweet herbs and cinnamon spice on the nose. The lithe palate offers candied strawberry with thyme, anise and touches of garden herbs, with that red fruit flavor carrying deep into the finish. Would pair great with spicy food.",Qupé 2013 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley)
"The Sims is amped up in 2014, dark and thick and showing a roasted character. Mocha, black tea and Kahlua flavors push the palate into a gritty charred mode. It's delicious, liquorous, and suitable for smoky ribs or a juicy burger. Drink now through 2020.",Rex Hill 2014 Sims Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish. Give it another year or two of bottle age and drink after 2019.",Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Wood spice, cherry and herb aromas are followed by luscious cherry flavors. It keeps you coming back for more with a high yum factor.",Structure 2014 Wallula Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)

"A surprising whiff of black currant on the nose of this elegant white points to Scheurebe—one of Germany's lesser-known grapes. Wittmann's version is particularly poised, offering loads of peach and grapefruit flavors, sharply contrasted by zesty lime and mineral tones. The finish is long and sleek, touched by a hint of bee pollen.",Wittmann 2015 Trocken Scheurebe (Rheinhessen)
"This producer shows its preference for dry Champagnes with this bone-dry, oak-fermented bottling. With its bottle age and the softening effect of wood, it's generous and gently textured, leaving plenty of room for its bright fruit and balanced acidity to show. Drink from 2018.",Jeaunaux-Robin NV Brut Zéro Sélection  (Champagne)
"From the sought-after site on Westside Road, this wine delivers a nuanced, elegant expression of juicy red cherry, plum, pomegranate and light, compelling spice.

"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around. A flush saturated tannic palate is home to toasty blackened berry, coffee and spice flavors. On the finish, burnt toast and espresso flavors don't slip. Drink through 2022.",Lapostolle 2013 Cuvée Alexandre Apalta Vineyard Made With Organic Grapes Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
"One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.",Le Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon)
"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.",Le Cadeau 2015 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Slightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.",Le Cadeau 2015 Équinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

On the palate, this oak-aged Viura is smooth, while creamy flavors of oak, apricot and peach excel. A smooth finish with plenty of vanilla and core acidity indicates this will age well for another 10 years.",Marqués de Murrieta 2010 Capellanía Viura (Rioja)
"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now–2025.",Torbreck 2010 The Factor Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"A rather perfumed nose hints at the Gewurztraminer that colors this Riesling with rose petal and honeysuckle notes. The co-planted varieties in this vineyard make a smashing duo since they are almost polar opposites: structured, straight-laced Riesling with its fine spine of acidity benefits from the playfulness and charm of aromatic, fleshy Gewurztraminer which in turn is lit up by Riesling's freshness. Really, this is a case where you can have the best of both worlds.",Biecher & Schaal 2014 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace)
"A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016–2020.",Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kitterlé Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"There are mere hints of beeswax and marzipan on the nose. The palate opens into a structured, bright and well-lit space of pear peel, pear juice and a wonderfully bitter edge. This is off-dry and concentrated, definite but with a light touch. There is an intriguing hint of bitter orange peel that draws you in and pull this onto a higher plane.",Domaines Schlumberger 2012 Kessler Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.",Foxen 2014 Tinaquaic Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Completely stainless-fermented and aged, this is a blockbuster of a white wine, refreshing and exotic in floral intoxication. Dry and light-bodied, it offers an edginess of slate-like minerality along with aromas of apricot and peach, finishing in a dusting of white pepper.",Les Belles Collines 2014 Pinot Gris (California)
"This is a new wine from the hands of master winemaker Luis Duarte. With its rich black fruits and dense tannins, it's also a wine that is firmly structured.

The palate is dense and thick with more black fruit as well as caramel, purple flowers, milk chocolate and mint-chip ice cream, proving concentrated and decadent.",Niner 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Pommard and Wädenswil clones are combined here, yielding a stylish, well-defined wine with spicy berry fruit. Flavors punch through into a deep and detailed finish, with streaks of cola and caramel. The balance is spot-on.",Purple Hands 2014 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"As its name suggests this is a selection of barrels of Syrah and Touriga Nacional. It is rich, smooth and full of ripe fruit. The dusty tannins are in suspension, backing up the black plum and blueberry fruit flavors. Along with the juicy acidity, this is a wine to age. Drink from 2017.",Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Lagoalva Barrel Selection Tinto Red (Tejo)
"This is an impressive, powerful wine. It speaks of the hard landscape of the Douro Superior, with its structure and dark tannins. At the same time, ripe dark fruits push through the still-young tannins giving the potential for a rich, black fruit dominated wine. Predominantly Touriga Nacional (60 percent), this wine is a new venture created by João Nicolau d'Almeida (who has run Ramos-Pinto for many years) and his family. Drink from 2018.",Quinta do Monte Xisto 2013 Red (Douro)
"A spray of rose petals perfumes this aromatic spätlese. Its freshness is exhilarating, contrasting lavish layers of honey and marmalade against the sharp bites of pineapple, tangerine and lemon. Cutting and spry, yet deeply penetrating, it finishes on a lingering pollen note.",Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2014 Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese Grosse Lage Riesling (Mosel)
"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.",Stone The Crows 2013 Three Twins Vineyard Fallen Feather Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"You'll find aromas of tomato leaf, passion fruit, crushed rock and green bell pepper on this radiant white.

It's an extremely impressive showing for this challenging vintage.",Sturm 2014 Sauvignon (Collio)
"Subtle notes of clean, fresh lemon zest promise pleasure, the palate reveals a far riper aspect of fresh red apple and baked apples. The dry palate remains zingy and clean and provides ample textured freshness. The effect is that of fresh apple sorbet.",Kuentz-Bas 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.",Plantagenet 2014 Riesling (Great Southern)
"Reserved red-cherry fruit aromas gain complexity with fog-soaked sagebrush, dried purple flowers and an earthy mushroom character on the nose. Roasted shiitake, marjoram, crushed Brazil nuts and a hint of cardamom play on the dark, spicy, earthy palate, laid across a bed of cranberry fruit.",Scratch 2013 Grenache (Arroyo Seco)
"Freshly cut red, yellow and green apples make both nose and palate very fruity. The dry palate with its lemony freshness and open aspect lets all the apple flavors shine and inflects them here and there with baked and dried apple, too. Wonderfully fruity and pure.",Sipp Mack 2014 Rosacker Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.",St. Amant 2013 Lodi Native Marian's Vineyard Zinfandel (Mokelumne River)
"This cuvée is made with the oldest Pommard clones in the estate vineyard. It's a sharp-edged, reserve-level wine with a defining streak of peppery herb. The black fruits and barrel flavors of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate promise further depth as it ages. Drink 2020–2030.",Stoller 2013 Nancy's Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.",Fable Mountain 2011 Night Sky Red (Coastal Region)
"This full-bodied wine has a voluptuous entry that's slightly tropical in pineapple and Asian pear, as well as vanilla-layered oak. The expansive beginning segues smoothly into a higher-wire act of minerality, finishing fleshy and fresh.",Vine Cliff 2013 Chardonnay (Los Carneros)
"This wine brings aromas of blackberry, dates and spice. The palate displays abundant cherry flavors with lightly chalky tannins.",Va Piano 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Syrupy thick at first, decadent enough for a king, this rich red is defined by vanilla French toast and blackberry jam aromas and flavors. It finds balance midway through on the palate, veering into crisper red tones of cranberry and rhubarb. Time will help mellow things out. Cellar through 2020.",Y Rousseau 2012 Le Roi Soleil Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Livelier than usual in texture and popping with bright citrus aromas and flavors, this light-bodied and barrel-fermented wine is a great palate-cleanser and will pair beautifully with dishes like raw oysters and herbed goat cheese. It smells and tastes like lemon, lime, green apple and kiwi, and has great balance.",Monte Volpe 2013 Pinot Grigio (Mendocino)
"Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins.

The round, concentrated palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and tobacco framed in firm acidity and a velvety texture.",Poderi Colla 2013 Costa Bruna  (Barbera d'Alba)
"This warm-vintage wine is more aromatically reticent than recent vintages, with notes of stone fruit, slate and mineral. It drinks a hair off dry, with depth to the lightly spritzy fruit flavors and razor-sharp acidity.",Poet's Leap 2014 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))

"The winery's larger bottling of the variety, one it has mastered for decades, this wine is a mix of baked plum and rustic leather notes. It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper. With small amounts of other Rhône varieties, from Syrah to Viognier, it meanders to the finish, with a distinct trace of minerality.",Stags' Leap Winery 2012 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Similarly to it's Virgin Berry sibling, Roth's regular label Dry Riesling has a distinctly green, woodsy tone lending an alpine feel to sweet-tart peach and apricot flavors.

"This is a full-bodied and full-flavored wine with rich and deep aromas, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels substantial but polished.

The finish stays flavorful and dry.",The Withers Winery 2013 Charles Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"From a knoll in Carneros, oft thought of as chilly for Cabernet, this wine exhibits cooler aspects of the variety, from pencil lead and cedar to dried herb.

"Smoky cinnamon and nutmeg pierce the entry of this wine, a dense, full-bodied expression of place. Layers of rich cherry and strawberry lie over classic varietal earthiness, finishing medium in length.",Acacia 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros)

"This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone. Earthy spice and an exotic notion of orange blossom dance around a light, clear body and high-toned minerality. It hails from a foggy, shaded vineyard in Freestone.",Cobb 2012 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, berry and a balsamic note. The forward palate offers dried cherry, white pepper, tobacco and the warmth of alcohol alongside firm tannins. Drink this sooner rather than later.",Comm. G. B. Burlotto 2011 Acclivi  (Barolo)

Black pepper and soy mark the palate, along with blackberry juice and a slate-driven minerality.",Nadia 2012 Quattro Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Still closed, this is redolent of the elegant, nutty notes of new French oak which nonetheless complement the ripe but supple cherry fruit. The tannins are superfine and the addition of peppery Zweigelt to this Cabernet-Merlot blend lends spice and verve to the mix. This was made for the long run, so give it some bottle age and allow it to meld into its elegant self. Drink from 2018.",Nittnaus Hans und Christine 2013 Nit'ana Red (Burgenland)
"This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.",Nottingham Cellars 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Micro-lot Reserve Malbec (Livermore Valley)
"Made with Sangiovese blended with 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante Bouschet, this savory wine opens with aromas of underbrush, ripe berry, tobacco leaf and Mediterranean herb.

Enjoy through 2020.",Poggio Argentiera 2012 Capatosta  (Morellino di Scansano)

Enjoy through 2017.",Pride Mountain 2012 Cabernet Franc (Sonoma County)
"This is a well-balanced, well-structured white wine that's sure to evolve through 2020, at least.

It's firm and well balanced.",Ruffino 2010 Riserva Ducale Oro Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package.",Saint Clair 2014 Pioneer Block 20 Dillons Point Cash Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)

It's truly a standout wine at this price.",Woodinville Wine Cellars 2012 Little Bear Creek Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2022.",Kanonkop 2012 Estate Wine Pinotage (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now.",El Enemigo 2012 Bonarda (Mendoza)

"This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.",Château Vignelaure 2014 Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Classic gooseberry and pink grapefruit notes feature gentle herbal nuances on the nose. There's ample weight and texture on the palate, with a burst of mouthwatering citrus on the finish.",Cloudy Bay 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)

"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants.

"Floral and herbal from the get-go, this medium-bodied white from a great vineyard offers a lot to like.

The finish is medium in length and accented in spicy cardamom.",Failla 2013 Keefer Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This wine combines fruit from both cool and warm sites, which in the vintage might have both leaned on the warmer side. Black fruit and licorice give it a burly character at first. Decanting or letting the wine open in the glass will help, but still it retains smooth, velvety tannins and resolved oak.",Friedeman 2013 Dichotomy Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Alluring notes of Asian five spice and wet stone frame ripe cherry aromas in this medium-bodied wine.

Drink now–2018.",Akarua 2012 Bannockburn Pinot Noir (Central Otago)

"Peach, banana peel and a slight petrol note show mildly on the nose. The round palate boasts tart peach, pineapple rind and bitter lemon zest.",Mont Sec 2015 Mont Sec Vineyards Viognier (Texas)
"This has aromas that recall leafy underbrush, sawdust and menthol. The dense, oak-driven palate shows licorice, espresso, toast and a hint of bitter chocolate but the fruit has dried up. It abruptly ends on a green note of powdered sage.",Paolo Manzone 2012 Meriame  (Barolo)
"A rose pink colored wine that is dry and with ripe fruit. Its acidity contrasts with the warm red-berry fruit and the edge of tannin. There is a peppery, crisp aftertaste.",Quinta de Paços 2015 Casa de Paços Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Light strawberry fruit carries an undertone of dried grass. It turns a little sour in the mouth, but it's fine for the price.",Rascal 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish.",Terrazas de Los Andes 2015 Reserva Torrontés (Salta)

"Raisiny and earthy on the nose, this Bonarda also offers damp aromas of fern and tobacco. Chunky, with a soft, flat palate, this tastes raisiny and stewed. Low acidity and raisiny flavors on the finish are consistent with what came before.",Durigutti 2014 Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note.",El Esteco 2015 Don David Reserve Torrontés (Calchaquí Valley)
"A rare miss for this winery, this bottling shows cooked red cherries, dust, vanilla and caramel on the somewhat hollow nose. The palate is almost overly rich with caramelized black cherry, fudge and chalky tannins. Patience will likely improve this one.",Felten Cellars 2013 Tempranillo (Paso Robles)
"This raspberry-flavored wine is soft and ripe. While it is fruity, it also has a nutty character that gives it a rich taste. It's dry and in a style that will make it better with food than by itself.",Wines & Winemakers 2015 Casa Ermelinda Freitas Monte de Baía Rosé (Península de Setúbal)
"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors.",Lagarde 2013 Henry Legarde Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Roasted coffee bean and menthol aromas lead the nose while the evolved palate offers dark bitter chocolate, licorice and a toasted note. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit has largely dried up while astringent tannins lead to a bracing finish.",Marchesi di Barolo 2009 Riserva  (Barolo)

"Ripe plum and plenty of vanilla and cherry provide the perception of sweetness in this wine. That sensation may stem from the pushing-the-envelope generosity of the ripe fruit or from the oak. or both. It makes for a full-bodied, heady experience.",Pech Merle 2013 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This opens with unusual aromas that recall minestrone soup, celery and glazed onion that carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness and is rather muddled, offering flavors reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. Tasted both bottles, same notes.",Punset 2011 Campo Quadro Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"The grape is local to the Vidigueira region of the southern Alentejo. Coming from cool vineyards, the wine has a fresh character that is balanced by the ripe melon and juicy pear fruits. It has a crisper end and is ready to drink.",Ribafreixo 2015 Pato Frio Antão Vaz (Alentejo)

"The sweet scent of raspberry and strawberry preserves waft from this Cab Franc icewine from Casa Larga. On the palate as well, there's a nice concentration of preserved berry flavors that soar on the palate with a bright, sunny acidity. Finishes clean and long with just a hint of autumn leaves and bramble.",Casa Larga 2008 Fiori Delle Stelle Ice Wine Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)

Finishes round, with citrus and passion fruit.",De Martino 2010 347 Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)

"Shows the perfect balance and varietal richness that Anderson Valley Gewürztraminers are known for. With crisp acidity, it has exotic flavors of Asian pears, candied pears, tangerines, gingersnap cookies and dusty spices, with a dry finish. Would score much higher if it were more concentrated.",Handley 2009 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley)

"A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.","Monte De Oro 2006 Reserve, Vista del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)"

Offers a rich flavor profile but the acidity creates bite and sharpness.",Ninquén 2009 Antu Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)

"White fruits, flower blossom and a touch of brine work the nose, which is followed by flush, semisweet apple, gooseberry and lime flavors. More sweet than outright tangy, but still citrusy and zesty. Holds form on the crisp finish. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Pablo del Villar 2010 Ipsum Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)

Its length is excellent.",Patton Valley 2010 West Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

"The Winderlea is perhaps the most unique in terms of style and flavor among all the 2010 Adelsheim single-vineyard Pinots.

Complex and long, this is a wine that will surely spark some heated discussion.",Adelsheim 2010 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This is a powerful, almost concentrated, very dry selection. Its richness comes from the weight of its fruit flavors and the tight tang of its intense acidity. From a fine vintage, it could still age for several more years. Disgorged July 2011.",Bruno Paillard 2002 Assemblage Brut  (Champagne)

"The nose of this wine combines this grape's best attributes: bright, crisp citrus redolent in grapefruit and Key lime, but with a tropical touch of guava and pineapple. The palate is broad and ripe but restrained enough, with plush mango and guava laid against a chalky backbone.",Buttonwood 2015 Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is the second wine from one of the group of chateaus with Corbin in their names. It is a tight wine, firm with tannins and with a concentrated texture and flavors of over-extraction. That said, the wine will probably develop over time into something serious with a dark, dense aftertaste.",Château Corbin 2014 Divin de Corbin  (Saint-Émilion)
"This is a perfumed wine, with mint flavors as well as blackberry fruits. There is still a dominant structure of tannins and the wood aging that will allow the wine to age well.

"Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice.

"This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate.

This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.",Aiken 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)

"Bruised apple and dandelion notes play spicily on the textured, slightly phenolic palate. The central streak of freshness brightens all aspects of the wine, which might gain complexity with a year or two more in bottle. For now it remains intriguingly poised between earthy richness and ethereal lift.",Domaine Roland Schmitt 2014 Grand A du Petit Léon Sylvaner (Alsace)
"A dusting of crushed slate and saffron accents this zesty lime and honey kissed Kabinett.

"Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release.

Rita Hills)

"Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors.

"Ripe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors.

"From a large 177-acre estate in the southern Graves, this wine shows plenty of stalky, black currant fruits, fresh acidity and spice from wood. It has just the right characters for a food Bordeaux, dry core of tannins and vivid fruit around.",Château Pavillon de Boyrein 2006  Graves
"Here's a Trebbiano-based wine from the Lake Garda area in northern Italy that delivers smooth consistency and expressive notes of stone fruit, citrus, honey and crushed stone. The wine would pair well with lake fish or vegetable dishes.",Fabiano 2006 Argillaia  (Lugana)
"Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.",Vinosia 2006 Vecchie Vigne  (Primitivo di Manduria)
"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased. Kono's 2008 is on the light side, but tart and zippy, with a refreshing aspect to its pineapple and grapefruit flavors and herbal overtones. Drink now.",Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Light and tropical, with buttercup aromas and a touch of citrus. The palate is plump and slightly oily, but with good acidity. Apple, mango and banana flavors are fruity and sweet, but overall the wine holds it together. Drink right away.",Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Corvina, Rondinella and Dindarella—three grapes native to the Verona area of Northern Italy—make up this fresh and lively, easy-sipping rosé. The wine awards pretty aromas of raspberry and white cherry.",Tommasi 2006 Chiaretto  (Bardolino Classico)
"Good introductory Carmenère. It's a touch green, which is common for this quality level, but there's also some coconut and mild burnt aromas to wade through. Lively and clanky on the palate, with red fruit, bramble and herbal snap. Good if you're not expecting too much.",Morandé 2008 Pionero Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"A little tough and gritty, but okay for everyday fare. Shows blackberry, currant, tobacco and herb flavors that turn sweetly fruity on the finish.",One Hope 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Although it is labeled “Extra Dry” (that is sweeter than Brut), this lively Champagne in its festive little pink bottle is very fresh, with delicious acidity. It finishes lightly, easily.",Pommery NV Pop Rosé Extra Dry  (Champagne)
"Sweet in jammy apricots and pineapples, with even richer notes of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity fortunately provides some balance. From Venge Vineyards.",Saddleback 2008 Viognier (Clarksburg)
"A bit earthy and herbal, and soft, with cherry and cocoa fruit flavors. The acidity and tannin structure could be firmer.",Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Alexander School Reserve Big Barrel Syrah (Alexander Valley)
"It's soft, slightly oxidized, and generic. It's pleasantly quaffable, marked in the finish by some rather bitter toast.",Covington 2006 Rough House Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Fabio Sireci is behind some of Sicily's best Nero d'Avola and has more recently decided to flex his winemaker muscle on Pinot Noir. The results are a tad jammy and muddled (his vineyards are smack in the middle of the Mediterranean island), ending with ripe aromas of prune and raisin.",Feudo Montoni 2008 P Pinot Noir (Sicilia)
"Clean and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus, pear, green apple, vanilla and honey. Finishes with that well-known K-J sweetness. A blend based on Sauvignon Blanc.",Kendall-Jackson 2008 Summation Vintner's Reserve White (California)
"Sweet and simple, with pleasantly exotic flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, honeysuckle flowers, minerals, spices, vanilla, brown sugar and smoky oak. Easy to drink.",Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Viognier (Suisun Valley)
"A little on the sweet side, but crisp in acidity, and front-loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle and spicy vanilla flavors. Sauvignon Blanc, Muscat Blanc, Chardonnay and Roussanne.",X 2008 White X White (North Coast)
"A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front.",Château Lamothe-Vincent 2008 Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.",Montresor 2003 Capitel della Crosara  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.",Yvon Mau 2007 Premius Bordeaux Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity.",Bellenda 2005 Col di Luna Cabernet Sauvignon (Piave)
"Off-dry, with sugary flavors of apricots, pears, flowers, vanilla and dusty Asian spices. Crisp acidity provides needed balance. Try with Vietnamese, Thai or Burmese fare.",Breggo 2008 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley)
"An intriguing nose of tobacco, mint, cherry and spice leads this earthy red. Flavors of spice, tobacco, red berry and tea are supported by ageable tannins and good complexity.",Byzantium 2005 Rosso di Valachia Red (Dealu Mare)
"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.",Pascual Toso 2007 Reserve Las Barrancas Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This is a sweet, rich Port. Its aromas are of soft berry jelly, with a ripe herbal character. To taste, it is concentrated, but the sweetness of the fruit masks its density. Berry and dried fruits make an attractive blend, leaving a firmer structure in the aftertaste.",Quinta de la Rosa 2004 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"While lacking the vibrant fruit typical of the variety, there are some attractive hay and honey scents on nose. The full-bodied and soft-textured palate is cloaked in vanilla, which lingers on the finish.",Sieber Rd 2007 Viognier (Barossa Valley)
"This is a classic, high-acid vintage. The strength is fruit, and it's a mix of citrus and light pineapple; all stainless fermented and finished at moderate alcohol. Quite different in style from the '06, but well-made.",Lachini 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Mauro will always show you a lot, but frankly this 2005 seems soft and chunky. It has rich, baked, black-fruit aromas and then a mildly syrupy palate with huge blackberry and cassis flavors. The finish is wide and rich, but where are the tannins and structure that this wine is known for? Drink now for best results; it may not improve in the cellar. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Mauro 2005 Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Good price for a crisp white wine that's this polished. Nice on its own for the savory citrus, spearmint and spicy vanilla flavors, and fine with everything from fried chicken to Cantonese.",Dancing Bull 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A remarkably rich, spicy, attractive red. It obviously has new wood, but its use is judicious, leaving the mint, black berry and soft tannins of the fruit to come through well.",Domaine de Mirail 2005 Les Mirlandes Red (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"Made from Fer Servadou, Duras and Syrah, this is a wine with a truly local pedigree and a modern style, with prominent new wood. There are aromas that talk of wild heather and a dry landscape and palate notes of spice, ripe berries and prunes.",Domaine des Terrisses 2006 Grande Tradition Red (Gaillac)
"A delicious wine, the Chenin Blanc giving both mineral and spice flavors, contrasting with the richer Chardonnay. Apricot and sweet melon flavors are supported by a fine, surprisingly complex structure. Fresh currants mark the refreshing finish.",Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne)
"An enticingly perfumed wine, with its white flowers and apricot blossom. The palate is soft, rich, moving towards yellow fruits, ripe pink grapefruit and just an edge of mineral chalkiness.",Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Belles Vignes  (Sancerre)
"Edèlmio is a sophisticated and toasty blend of Carricante and Chardonnay with fragrant aromas of stone fruit, peach, mineral, almond and freshly chopped pear. The wine is broad and generous in terms of its mouthfeel and would make a perfect companion to swordfish with mint and roasted eggplant.",Benanti 2006 Edèlmio White (Sicilia)
"Here's a Syrah with bursting aromas of mature blueberry, cherry, spice and smoked bacon. The wine is full, round and generous with a supple feel and soft concentration. Pair it with lamb or roasted pork.",Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Syrah (Sicilia)
"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink now–2014.",Yalumba 2006 Patchwork Shiraz (Barossa)
"Rich in the mouth, this creamy and textural wine mixes fruit flavors of peach, apple and pear in equal proportion. It's a bit heavier than the previous vintage, with less of the floral character, but it offers, instead, a richness that lingers into a satisfying finish.",The Four Graces 2007 Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"Creamy and textural, this brings on a nice mix of apple, pear and Key lime fruit flavors, fresh and pretty. Just a hint of minerality adds interest to the finish.",Amity 2006 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Arcane's Cab is stylistically apart from either California or Washington. It defines its own space. There's plenty of new oak, but the fruit, acid and tannins stand up to it. This is sharp and tangy; cranberry and raspberry, strawberry and citric acids all playing their part. Still young, give it some time in a decanter or in your cellar to come together and show its best.",Arcane Cellars 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
"Nerello Mascalese, a grape native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna, delivers fresh berry notes that recall raspberry, blueberry and mulberry backed by toasted almond. There are pretty mineral nuances woven within its texture and the wine ends with polished tannins and menthol freshness. It is aged 12 months in oak, but you hardly taste the wood.",Benanti 2005 Il Monovitigno  (Etna)
"Aromas of cherry, spice and mint lead into tart pie cherry and wild berry fruit, dusted with cocoa and spiced up with 16 months in French oak barrels. Unusual for most high-end Pinots, this is sealed with a screwcap.",Benton-Lane 2006 First Class Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
The richness of vintage 2003  shows in this wine's layers of dried fruits on top of sweet tannins and a dense concentration. There is some licorice flavor arriving as the wine matures.,Château Puy-Servain 2003 Vieilles Vignes  (Montravel)
"Full, firm white wine that gives good green fruit and pear flavors, lifted with spice from wood. The wine is round, while still retaining crispness from grassy acidity, and offers a good depth of plum skin structure and flavor.",Château Puy-Servain 2007 Marjolaine  (Montravel)
"A full, soft Sauvignon from close to Sancerre. There is a light, yeasty character to this young wine, but the fruit is all there—fresh pink grapefruit, lime and green berries. The finish is acidic and crisp, but still mouth-filling.",Domaine Philippe Portier 2007  Quincy
"This bold, expressive Pinot Noir bursts open with spice, herb and leaf then rolls into flavors of vanilla cream and tangy red fruits. The spicy elements wrap into all the other flavors, giving lift and life; this is an exciting wine, though not necessarily one to cellar.",Expression 44° 2006 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Concentrated, with white fruits, a strong streak of herbaceousness, green apples and a rich texture. The wine shows intensity as well as youth. It really needs another year before drinking.",Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Les Caillottes  (Pouilly-Fumé)
"Intense and focused, this good value Coonawarra opens with notes of leather and polished wood overlaid with red-berry fruit. Tannins are smooth, but there's plenty of lip-smacking acidity to keep the cherry cordial and plum fruit flavors lively. Drink now. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Nick Faldo 2005 Shiraz (Coonawarra)
"Denser and less herbal than the 2005 Gran Reserva, with fresh cassis and plum fruit to go with some chocolaty overtones. This has plenty of intensity and structure.",Tarapaca 2006 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This is a very interesting wine. It has many different flavor threads that have not quite interwoven. To begin there is a surplus of acid, leaving a chalky sensation that has not yet smoothed out. The fruit flavors are also sharp and tart—red fruits from wild berries to pomegranate to sour cherry. The aromas suggest some light chocolate from the barrel aging, and it shows up in the finish, along with herb and vanilla. So, there's lots going on, but it has not yet come together in a harmonious whole.",The Four Graces 2005 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.",Hunt Country Vineyards 2007 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes)
"This ruby-hued blend of Nerello Mascalese and Nerello Cappuccio conveys aromas of bright berry, intense mint and a whiff of baking spice. The vibrant palate offers sour cherry, mineral and cinnamon flavors alongside fresh acidity.",Antichi Vinai 1877 2013 Pietralava Red (Etna)
"Aromas suggest oak, vanilla, bell pepper and cassis. The palate offers black cherry, cranberry, vanilla, mocha and oak alongside astringent, drying tannins.",Baglio di Pianetto 2007 Cembali Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"This blend from a newer Westside Paso winery offers blackberry, charred pine and sour cherry aromas. The palate is driven by pine sap, charred game and sharp herbs such as oregano and rosemary, and would be a great way to spice up a steak dinner.",Brecon Estate 2012 Forty Two Red (Paso Robles)
"A nice tarry funk along with dried mint and menthol cigarette scents characterize the nose of this blend of 63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Syrah and 4% Petite Verdot. The creosote sense carries to the palate, meeting with black cherry, dried bouquet garni and quite grippy tannins.",Callaway 2010 Profonde Winemaker's Reserve Red (Temecula Valley)
"Aromas of ripe dark berry, blue flower and a hint of baking spice waft from the glass. On the palate, notes of graphite, licorice and touch of smoke add depth to the ripe black cherry flavors. Firm tannins provide support.",Casa di Grazia 2011 Gradiva Collectio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Citrus, yellow apple, orange blossom and saline aromas take center stage. On the palate, notes of savory herb accent creamy apple and pear flavors that are brightened by fresh acidity and a mineral note.",Casa di Grazia 2013 Zahara Grillo (Sicilia)
"This wine is still young, showing spice and not yet enough fruit. It has the right weight and potential richness as well as concentration from the old vines. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2016.",Ruhlmann 2013 Vieilles Vignes Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Estate bottled, this assemblage of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot opens with a flurry of coconut flake and herb, followed by ripe, rich layers of dark berry and black tea. The wine has power yet also possesses an elegance that stands out, finishing with a taste of dark caramel.",Spring Mountain Vineyard 2011 Elivette Red (Napa Valley)
"Creamy and fresh, this is made from estate-grown grapes, fermented in a mix of stainless steel and neutral barrels. The fruit flavors blend jicama, melon and pear, with a touch of sweetness. It finishes with a hint of honeysuckle.",Stanton Vineyard 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.",Terrazas de Los Andes 2012 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Made entirely with Insolia, this opens with subdued aromas of tropical fruit and white spring flower. The bright, linear palate offers passion fruit, peach, nectarine zest and a hint of ginger alongside crisp acidity.",Cusumano 2013 Cubia Tenuta Ficuzza Insolia (Sicilia)
"This offers aromas of honeydew melon and vanilla. On the palate, gentle flavors of nutmeg, cinnamon and eucalyptus predominate over a bright burst of citrus. Tannins are a tad bold for a relatively delicate white wine, but they are tempered by baking spice flavors that wash across the tongue and notes of tangerine on the back palate.",Dalton 2013 Alma Semillon-Viognier-Pinot Gris White (Galilee)
"The Pfleck vineyard with its clay and limestone soil gives a rich style of Pinot Gris. This wine, with its intense spice and lychee flavors, is typical. It has a crisp edge but the ripe fruitiness and touch of pepper give weight and richness. Drink now.",Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2012 Pfleck Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This is a softer Sauvignon Blanc for those not sworn to the grassy side of the grape, as the Buellton-based winery does a lot of barrel-fermenting. Aromas include pressed kiwi and a sour pucker of lime, and the broiled pear flavors prove easy drinking, if not exceedingly complex.",Dragonette 2012 Vogelzang Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Smooth-drinking, this offers soft, mellow flavors of melon and pear. Light but persistent, it's a clean, fresh and appealing selection, best enjoyed now.",Firesteed 2013 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.",Folin Cellars 2012 Estate Grenache (Rogue Valley)
"This lighter-bodied Mencía from Valdeorras shows exotic, minerally aromas of raspberry, blueberry and Middle Eastern spices. The palate runs crisp and fresh, but not real deep or intense. Flavors of raspberry, plum and schist finish dry and floral, with a touch of lasting oak.",Gaba do Xil 2012 Mencía (Valdeorras)
"Clean, peachy aromas set up a light, minerally, citrusy body. Flavors of gooseberry, lime and lemon hold steady and double up on gooseberry on the finish. Overall, this is round, minerally and elegant, but also slightly sour and edgy.",Gorka Izagirre 2013 White (Bizkaiko Txakolina)
"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.",Grgich Hills 2012 Miljenko's Selection Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Leathery cherry and cassis aromas are softened up by baking spice accents. In the mouth, this is hard-edged and pointed, with sharp, lemony acidity. Flavors of spiced plum and pie cherry finish with jagged acids and heat. This is a real enamel-peeler; more time in bottle can only help.",Linaje Garsea 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is a soft, slightly sweet rendering of Pinot Gris, loaded with succulent pear, pineapple and melon fruit. Chill it well and sip it by the pool this summer.",Omaka Springs 2013 Pinot Gris (Marlborough)
"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County. The cider element carries to the rather pungent palate, proving quite high-toned and acidic with some minerality, grapefruit peel grip and long-lasting vibrancy on the finish.",Ventana 2013 Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"With its few years of aging, this is now a ripe and broad wine rich in yellow fruits that are cut with pear juice. It has nutty overtones, and a bright, crisp aftertaste.",Vieil Armand 2010 Clos de la Tourelle Château Ollwiller Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"This juicy, delicious red features aromas of red berry, Mediterranean brush and aromatic herb. The easygoing palate doles out ripe blackberry, crushed Morello cherry, a charred note and a touch of baking spice alongside smooth, supple tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the succulent fruit.",Viticultori Associati Canicatti 2012 Aquilae Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"An attractive fragrance of white flower, stone fruit, apple and a whiff of smoke opens this linear wine. The bright palate offers dried citrus, Golden Delicious apple and mineral alongside brisk acidity.",Vivera 2010 Salisire Bianco  (Etna)
"This wine offers notes of toasted vanilla bean, herbs and red fruit. It's broad in feel while the fruit flavors are elegant in style, with the supple feel bringing much of the enjoyment.",WildAire 2012 Spofford Station Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"This lacks a bit of midpalate richness, but otherwise offers fine drinking. Clove, cinnamon and leather complexities keep the cherry flavors interesting, while the finish is clean and crisp. Drink now.",Mills Reef 2012 Gimblett Gravels Reserve Merlot-Malbec (Hawke's Bay)
"Varietally correct aromas of peach and melon form a good opening to this mostly fresh but fading Albariño. Flavors of melon, papaya and peach are typical for the grape, and the finish is holding on but showing signs of maturation. Drink immediately.",Pazo Torrado 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.",Sur de los Andes 2012 Clásico Malbec (Mendoza)
"In marked contrast to the plush, sexy 2010, the 2011 Patriarch is a stern taskmaster. The aromas and flavors of cherry, cedar and dried herbs are pleasant, but carry with them a worring dry astringency. Try drinking this over the near term, with rare beef to help ameliorate the tannin's effects.",Babich 2011 The Patriarch Premium Red (Hawke's Bay)
"A pretty decent Rioja for the vintage, but you're going to have to be ready for some rubbery aromas and then staunch red fruit with a little bite. It's quite the traditional wine, with lemon peel, leather and tobacco. Runs short on the finish.",Rentas de Fincas 2003 Crianza  (Rioja)
"The lightest in a range of Grüner Veltliner from Hans Setzer. This is a green apple and grapefruit flavored wine, all lightness, freshness and crispness. There is a green plum skin tang to it, added to citrus.",Setzer 2007 Vesper Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"The wine boasts a pretty golden hue and segues to tones of almond skin, stone fruit, nut and cardboard. It feels smooth and rich in the mouth and has some tart citrus flavors on the close.",Tenuta Luisa 2007 Rive Alte Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli)
"Far and away the freshest and most interesting of the three vintages submitted for review. The fruit retains more of its youthful gloss; it's riper and shows more cherry character, along with bright, spicy highlights. The tannins are proportionate and less earthy and herbal. This is no barn-burner, but it's a good quaffer.",Honeywood Winery 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"There's a saccharin or soda-like element to the nose of this Verduzzo-Friulano blend that gives the wine a cheerful, upfront personality but that overpowers the natural fruit. The wine tastes both tart and sweet and ends with butterscotch candy flavors.",I Clivi 2004 Bianco degli Arzillari White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"This is a pretty good buy for a Merlot that shows lots of polish and sophistication. It has savory black cherry, currant, cola and spice flavors. The tannins are a little rugged and green, so it loses some points.",Irony 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Created by music industry businessman Kedar Massenburg (CEO Motown Records), the K'orus range is produced in the Languedoc. This Cabernet Sauvignon gives blackberry fruits, very juicy, lightly sweet to finish, but retaining attractive structure and acidity.",Kedar's K'orus NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Easy, creamy wine, with soft apple flavors and a touch of citrus. There is a light edge of toast to round out the soft, fleshy aftertaste.",Kedar's K'orus NV Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Shows plenty of lush, ripe fruit, wrapped in soft tannins and balanced with crisp acids. The forward black cherry, red licorice, orange and smoky vanilla flavors are rich, and the price makes it a great value.",Little Black Dress 2006 Merlot (California)
"Quite leesy and funky, with meaty, oily aromas that are a departure from normal Albariño and are indicative of the 30% Treixadura and Loureiro that beef things up. Perfectly drinkable, and with a decent mouthfeel, but still it lacks the straightforward cleanliness of the really good wines from Galicia. Imported by Republic National Distributing Co.",Marqués de Vizhoja 2007 Señor da Folla Verde White (Rías Baixas)
"Estancia produces solid, savory Pinot Grigios at a fair price, and they even dropped their price last year. This one's a little off-dry, with crisp acidity and pleasant citrus, peach and honeysuckle flavors.",Estancia 2007 Pinot Grigio (California)
"With tobacco, molasses, spearmint and baked fruit aromas, this finds itself squarely in the old school forum. The palate shows straight-ahead red fruit with light herbal and pepper accents. Snappy and a bit thin, but it offers all the basics.",Finca La Emperatriz 2000 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Grassy and tonic with background shadings of white flower and stone fruit, this Ribolla Gialla offers aromas of white peach, kiwi and subtle hints of exotic fruit. The wine is crisp and lean in the mouth.",Vinai dell'Abbate 2006 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Beyond the spice of this cool-climate wine,  the flavors offer red berry fruits, fresh acidity and stalky tannins. It's soft, easy to drink now.",Winzer Krems 2005 Sandgrube 13 Chremisa Zweigelt (Kremstal)
"One of the original in the new generation of light, fresh Grüner Veltliner, Veltlinsky is a good example. With its green apple directness and smooth structure, it is a wine for the year, a fine apéritif or seafood partner. Screwcap.",Graf Hardegg 2007 Veltlinsky Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"A little tart and pickled off the bat, with notes of rhubarb and red cherry along with a stronger, more evident blast of oak. The palate is fresh but sort of lean and wanting, with regular raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy but slightly sappy and resiny for what's on offer.",Botalcura 2006 El Delirio Reserve Syrah-Malbec Red (Central Valley)
"This is the kind of wine someone serves at a big party, maybe in paper cups, along with the canapes, and you're delighted because it's actually pretty good. It's dry, soft and chocolaty, with a rich undertow of blackberries and currants.",Bridgeway 2004 Syrah (Central Coast)
"La Piazza is a line of wine from Sicily's Calatrasi winery that uses fruit from various parts of Italy. This is their Pinot Grigio from northern Italy that tastes rich and creamy and is made in a New World style. Aromas revolve around butter, almond paste, peach and apricot. It doesn't have huge length, but it does taste rich and dense.",Calatrasi 2006 La Piazza Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"As in nearby Sauternes, 2005 produced some exceptionally rich botrytised wine in Monbazillac. This example from one of the leading Bergerac producers certainly shows plenty of richness, but it seems rather too sugary, showing toffee flavors and fatness. The acidity is missing.",Château Bélingard 2005  Monbazillac
"For those with a classical bent, Clos Teddi is named after Thetis, sea goddess and mother of Achilles. This rosé, appropriately, summons up lunch by the ocean, with its crisp, fresh, dry strawberry and pink grapefruit flavors, just touched by caramel.",Clos Teddi 2007 Rosé Red (Patrimonio)
"Young spring flowers, lemongrass, green melon and dandelion come to mind and color what is a fresh wine with an easy, no-fuss approach. There's no big complicated story here, but that's exactly the point.",Colutta 2007 Friulano (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Layered and rustic, this wine starts with aromas of tobacco and sausage and leads into spicy, dark fruit flavors. Vibrant with supple tannins, the wine needs some time.",Ormonde 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Darling)
"This is a ripe, slightly jammy blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot with tones of cooked spice and blackberry pie. There are also some green leafy notes in the back backed by dense black tea that come as a surprise. You'll feel some grit on the palate and more fruit flavors on the close.",Principe di Corleone 2004 Evoè Red (Sicilia)
"Ripe and fruity, this is already delicious, but that doesn't detract from the firm tannins and density of a wine that will age well. It has all the elements, with the fruit, solid tannins and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from 2025.",Sandeman 2015 Quinta do Seixo Vintage  (Port)
"Composed, complex and complete, this mellow wine is very comfortable in its skin. Touches of oak, tobacco, dried plum and cardamom fill the aroma, and ripe but not overripe black cherry, tamarind and cola flavors flood the palate, supported by fine-grained tannins and medium-full body.",Scott Harvey 2012 Old Vine Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County)
"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola. Approachable and delicious, it hits the mark on every level being light bodied and refreshingly balanced while complex.",Sea Slopes 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"With its distinctive black label, this reserve is set apart from the winery's expanding lineup of Pinots. It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.",Trisaetum 2014 Family Reserve MMXIV Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Sourced from the estate's original 1999 plantings, this is a chewy, majestic, earthy and deeply dark wine. Its black fruit is ribbed wtih iron, licorice, coffee and graphite notes and framed by earthy tannins that lend texture. It drinks bigger than its listed alcohol would suggest.",Bergström 2015 Bergström Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This single vineyard wine is a blend of six separate blocks, each planted to a different clone. It deftly combines savory herb flavors with ripe Bing cherry fruit. The tannins are polished, textured and balanced, leading into a long finish that leaves a final impression of composted earth.",Bergström 2015 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir
"This wine's enticing rose, blue flower, menthol and herb scents come together in the glass. On the taut, precise palate, tightly knit, refined tannins enwrap crunchy red cherry and juicy cranberry flavors. White pepper and clove notes add depth, while bright acidity lends balance. Drink 2023–2035.",Mauro Veglio 2013 Castelletto  (Barolo)
"This is a major Douro wine from the Poças family-owned Port and wine producer. Dusty tannins already give it class as well as richness. Packed with black-plum fruits and with good concentration, the wine is still maturing. It needs to age further, so drink from 2019.",Poças 2014 Símbolo Red (Douro)
"Full of ripe fruit, this wine is rich while also having a delicately perfumed character. With its spice, generous fruits and sense of poise, it will age well. Drink from 2027.",Quinta do Vesuvio 2015 Vintage  (Port)
"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025.",Schild Estate 2013 Moorooroo Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass. A strong floral component of jasmine invites on the nose, while sparkling acidity maintains a freshness amidst the integrated oak and delicious flavors of honeyed pear and crème brûlée.",Shafer 2015 Red Shoulder Ranch Chardonnay (Carneros)
"From old vines planted in a single vineyard, this is a spectacular red. It has the crisp acidity of the cool-climate Sancerre, but it also has the weight and ripeness of a fine Burgundy. The wood aging has left a spicy toasty edge to the beautiful cherry fruits and acidity. It could age for another year to be at its best. Drink from 2019.",Alphonse Mellot 2014 En Grands Champs  (Sancerre)
"This savory, firmly structured, full-bodied red opens with subtle dark berry, rose petal, pipe tobacco and crushed herb aromas. It delivers layers of juicy Marasca cherry, black raspberry, cinnamon and clove flavors, buttressed by youthfully assertive but refined tannins and nicely balanced, with fresh acidity. Drink 2023–2033.",Ascheri 2013 Ascheri  (Barolo)
"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.",Bergström 2015 Old Stones Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"This winery is earning a place among Oregon's best with its top tier wines, like this one. Complex and loaded with bee pollen, crisp apple, lime zest, seabreeze and toasted cracker notes, it leaves you breathless the longer it breathes.",Big Table Farm 2015 Elusive Queen Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"As characterful as the dry version but with lower alcohol and a slight hint of sweetness, this boasts powerful tangerine, quince and Meyer lemon fruit. Its electric acidity keeps it vivid and beautifully balanced. Delicious now, it's also cellar-worthy.",Trisaetum 2016 Ribbon Ridge Estate Riesling (Ribbon Ridge)
"More tart than sweet, this delicious wine is packed with lemon drop, candied pineapple and tangerine fruit. The acidity is in perfect proportion with the slightly sweet palate, giving it a vivid mouthfeel that extends into the finish and offers versatility for food pairing.",Trisaetum 2016 Wichmann Dundee Estate Riesling (Dundee Hills)
"Lighter in color, this wine is aromatic and expressive, with notes of fire pit, blood, black olive tapenade, sea salt, black pepper, cured meat, nori, crushed flowers and umami. The palate brings soft, lithe, focused notes of earth and savory flavors that shimmer on the salty finish. It's all about delicacy but the aroma and flavor expression is compelling. Give it some time in the cellar or decant.",Horsepower 2014 The Tribe Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Estate-grown, this 100% varietal wine impresses in its total embrace of succulent blackberry, plum and mocha goodness, built upon a mountain of structured tannin and quiet oak. Touches of milk chocolate play along the palate as it rides along a velvety roadway, finishing soft and silky.",J. Davies 2013 Malbec (Diamond Mountain District)
"The Meridian in the name is the zero-longitude Prime Meridian which passes through this vineyard.

Refined acidity contributes to an overall lightness, with dried herb and dust lingering on the finish.",Tres Sabores 2014 Perspective Estate Zinfandel (Rutherford)
"All Trisaetum's dry Rieslings feel a notch riper in this warm year, to good effect. Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuvée. Concentrated pear, peach and papaya flavors are on display here, with tangy acidity and superb length and richness. It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.",Trisaetum 2016 Coast Range Dry Riesling
"Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.",Williams Selyem 2015 Terra De Promissio Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"The aromas of this wine leap from the glass, with notes of orange peel, potpourri, smoked meat, spice, fresh herb, stem, ash and plum. It's expressive, but still wound up. The flavors are focused, concentrated and savory, bringing a sense of intensity and richness but also lightness. The balance is exquisite.",Cayuse 2014 Cailloux Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",Chappellet 2013 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"Ripe, fruity and balanced, this has the potential to be a delicious, not-too-concentrated wine. Acidity and some dry tannins give the wine a firm character that is balanced by the fragrant berry fruits. Drink from 2026.",Churchill's 2015 Quinta da Gricha Vintage  (Port)
"From a three-acre spot known to get a hearty dose of fog, this wine speaks to cool-climate character, unveiling crisp floral layers of dried sage and white pepper from the get-go. Those aspects are joined by rose, lavender and cranberry-rhubarb on the palate, finishing with subtle offerings of mushroom and forest floor.",Cobb 2014 Emmaline Ann Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"From vines planted in 1976, this aromatic wine shows the depth that old vines can bring. Strawberry, cola, butter (from 14 months in 50% new French oak), wild cherry and more come into focus, and although delicate, they last and last on the palate. The finish is spectacular.",Dion 2014 Old Vines Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Old-vine Pinot Noir has produced a rich structured wood-aged wine. With its opulent texture and ripe full-bodied cherries and red plums, the wine is poised and generous. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",Domaine Bernard Fleuriet et Fils 2015 Anthocyane  (Sancerre)
"This reserve-level wine from the Roserock vineyard, Domaine Drouhin's recent Eola-Amity Hills planting, is compelling. Dense and fragrant, it boasts a beguiling mix of rose, cocoa powder and Asian spice, like a magic carpet ride of flavor. A finishing note of chocolate-covered orange peel is the pièce de résistance.",Drouhin Oregon Roserock 2014 Zéphirine Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"The winery shows its prowess with making delicious, affordable larger-production wines with this bright and easy drinking Cabernet, a study in soft tannins, juicy cranberry/currant fruit and composed structure. It's a good one to stock up on at the price and quality.",Robert Mondavi 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"With the scent of watermelon chapstick leading the way, this is a fruit-forward wine you want to kiss. Other aromas on the sweet-and-spicy nose include stewed plums and a dill-led herbal element. The flavors of red fruits and brown spice make for a completely delicious experience.",Sextant 2011 Caverio G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Despite showing gritty, scratchy aromas of baked, earthy black fruits, this Carignan-led blend is rock solid and ready. Tight, punchy, focused acidity sets up a rustic palate with a mix of baked-fruit flavors, spice and char. A toasty, dark, long finish is staunch and sturdy. Drink through 2016.",Valdivieso 2008 Éclat Vigno Old Vine Blend Red (Maule Valley)
"Wild thyme and moss blaze a savory trail before honeyed sweetness, cut by wonderfully precise, lemon-sharp acidity. This is linear and superclean, and that wonderful sweet-acid contrast should make this BA a winner both with the dessert trolley and the cheeseboard.",Weixelbaum 2013 Wahre Werte Beerenauslese Chardonnay (Niederösterreich)
"There's a ying-yang of rich crème brûlée, lemon curd and toasted oak amid good acidity and fresh apple and pear fruit, with inviting aromas to boot. Creamy and crisp it'll serve well aside all manner of seafood, like fresh-caught trout.",Landmark 2012 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)

"This is as perfumed an example of Syrah as you'll find from the Southern Rhône. Hints of herbs, spice and violets accent blueberry fruit in this charming wine. It's medium in body—not that rich but or layered but supple, silky and easily accessible. Drink this through the end of 2015.",Michel Gassier 2012 Les Piliers Syrah (Costières de Nîmes)
"Intense aromas of blue flower, red berry and licorice lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. Menthol, licorice, cake spices and a blast of orange zest complement the juicy, red cherry and black raspberry flavors.",Nada Fiorenzo 2011 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Boushey and Red Willow are the vineyards that contribute to this 100% varietal Cabernet Franc. There's excellent concentration to the brambly, bright, blackberry fruit, and some sharp acidity to underscore it. It's pure varietal and should continue to improve 2019–2021.",Barrage Cellars 2010 Outcast Cabernet Franc (Yakima Valley)
"Fresh, gushing fruit flavors such as raspberry, red cherry and boysenberry fill out this expressive and well-balanced wine. It is sweetly fruity in aroma, full-flavored, full-bodied, firm and dry in texture but not heavy. It craves ribs or wood-fired pizza.",Berryessa Gap 2011 California Series Zinfandel (Yolo County)
"Distinct crushed lava rock aromas meet with dust, cinnamon, cola and Dr Pepper on this blend of 28% Syrah, 22% Grenache, 17% Cinsault, 17% Mourvèdre and 16% Carignane. Light red fruits of cranberry and slight strawberry show on the palate that dives into serious tannins quickly.",Bonny Doon 2010 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast)
"Black currant, bell pepper and leather aromas lead the way on this blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, grilled pepper, mocha and cracked black pepper alongside bracing tannins.",Carpineto 2006 Sant'Ercolano  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)
"With a black color and deep, resiny aromas of licorice, baking spices and black fruits, this is a big, Tempranillo with plenty of size and tannic bite. Flavors of earthy, oaky, loamy plum and blackberry finish with licorice, spice and baked notes. Drink through 2018.",Casajús 2011 Antiguos Viñedos  (Ribera del Duero)
"The nose falls somewhere between smoky and gritty, while dusty white-fruit scents prop things up. Peachy acidity and citric tang let you know this is a “nature” Cava, while nectarine, rhubarb and green-herb flavors finish razor crisp and dry.",Castellroig 2010 Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"Dense almost to the point of chewiness, this is a concentrated blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache. Earthy, plummy notes pick up hints of dark chocolate and licorice before ending rich and velvety.",Château d'Or et de Gueules 2010 Les Cimels Red (Costières de Nîmes)

It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2013 Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Opening with aromas of underbrush, perfumed berries and crushed violets, this balanced Rosso displays its pedigree.

Enjoy now–2017.",Citille di Sopra 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"This 2008 holdover shows a mix of jammy, composed berry aromas as well as staunch notes of dried cheese and leather. The palate is firm at first, then more loamy and layered. On the flavor profile, baked berry blends with brine and cardamom, while on the finish this ready-to-drink RDD delivers licorice and earthy baked notes.",Condado de Oriza 2008 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"One of a string of great values made at Terravant near Santa Barbara. Attractively oaky, it's full-bodied, full-flavored and just tannic enough to make it a good pairing for rich meat or cheese courses. It is deep in color, with a slightly tawny rim. It smells like wood smoke and grilled bread, tastes deep as blackberry and delivers cherry flavors that linger on the finish.",Cookies & Cream 2010 Merlot (California)
"Rich cherry and spicy black pepper introduce the nose to this wine from the Adelaida district. The flavors explore the more nuanced, not overly jammy side of the grape, with tart acidity and a good tannic backbone ensuring a long life. Decent now, but better to drink 2018–2022.",Daou 2012 Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Ripe black plum, forest floor, mint and spice notes lead the nose on this savory, medium-bodied red. The succulent, straightforward palate doles out fleshy black cherry and crushed raspberry accented with black pepper and clove alongside round tannins. Drink through 2015.",Dei 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano
"A blend of white Bordeaux and local Gers grapes, this is a smooth, medium sweet wine. With three years of aging, it has become mature, rich in smoky flavors as well as dried apricot and bitter oranges. Acidity keeps everything in line. It's ready to drink.",Domaine de Gensac 2011 Quadrille White (Gers)

"This wine came out of the disaster of shriveled Duras grapes after an especially hot period. Rather than discarding them, Domaine Rotier made a wine. Wood aged, it has many of the characters of a late harvest with its rich, sweet, lightly tannic flavors and sufficient acidity to balance. A surprising success.",Domaine Rotier NV Noces de Feu Duras (Vin de Liqueur)
"While ebulliently peachy and floral on the nose, savory notes of dried reeds and savory herbs overwhelm the fruit flavors in this dry, light-bodied Riesling. It's crisp and refreshingly composed, but finishes a bit short. Drink now.",Three Brothers 2014 Zero Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Red apple, spice and honey aromas lead to medium-sweet fruit flavors. It brings some appeal but the concentration doesn't seem all there.",Wilridge 2014 Dessert Wine Estate Wilridge Vineyard Pinot Gris (Naches Heights)
"This wine is an unusual blend of Touriga (38%), Tinto Cão (20%), Tempranillo (18%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Souzão. Alcohol aromas show prominently along with dark fruit. The fruit flavors seem dried out, juxtaposed by the sweetness of the wine, with the tannins having a real sense of grip.",Wilridge 2014 Vintage Estate Dessert Wine Wilridge Vineyard Red (Naches Heights)
"This wine is tightly wound and thickly colored. Full bodied in style, it shows plenty of oak influence, aged in entirely French oak for 16 months, 42% of it new. Cranberry and sour cherry dominate in terms of fruit, with an underlying agenda of clove and tea.",Belden Barns 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)
"Based in the heart of the Haut-Médoc, this property has produced a wine that shows a dry character, with bitter extraction and too much wood. There are just hints of juicy fruit that will need time to come through. It could well stay dry and firm always.",Château du Retout 2013  Haut-Médoc
The producer has probably used too much wood for the fruit and density of this wine. The toastiness does not allow any fruit to show through.,Château la Gravette Lacombe 2013  Médoc
"This wine is lean with acidity playing over the red-currant fruits, leaving a character that's light and tight. While the wine will soften it's not likely to show any more weight or richness.",Château Méric 2013  Médoc
"Prickly aromas of juniper and cherry are sharp and lean towards green. This Malbec feels tight and lean, while plum and herbal aromas qualify as basic. A light, racy finish pinches and tastes generic.",Apaltagua 2014 Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley)
"This is a challenging mix of substantially puckering tannins and herbaceous notes, dotted in black peppercorns. The fruit is elusive.",In Re 2011 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Despite some ripe, honeyed aromas, this is light in body and quite lean on the palate. Underripe pineapple flavors show a tart, herbal edge on the finish.",Chasing Venus 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This soft, jammy and fruity wine is ready to drink, with black-currant flavors that are ripe and rounded. Only the lightest tannins gives any structure to this wine that is immediately accessible.",Château les Joyeuses 2014  Bordeaux
Too enthusiastic use of wood has left this wine bereft of fruit and unbalanced.,Château Monfort Bellevue 2012  Médoc
"This wine is structured and stalky without the fruit weight, reflecting the difficult vintage. A smoky character comes through the acidity to leave a dry aftertaste. Through 2016, it will soften a little, although always missing the fruit. The blend is 55% Merlot, 25% Cabernet Ssauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.",Château Vrai Caillou 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Prickly aromas of nettle are simple as well as diluted. This feels basic and fresh, while green, citrusy flavors end with pithy notes and an oily feel.",Concha y Toro 2015 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Sauvignon Blanc (Chile)
"This Zinfandel-dominant blend also contains Cabernet Franc and Petite Sirah in sizable amounts, rounded out by a handful of Merlot. Relatively light bodied, it has a muted nose. The flavors lean towards overripe, more dried fruit than fresh.",Experience 2012 Red (Napa Valley)
"This easygoing, simple red offers hints of dark berry flavors while a note of dark spice fleetingly appears in the background. It's uber-informal and rather diluted with a short but clean finish.",Cantine Grasso 2014 Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"This informal rosato offers delicate aromas and flavors of wild red berry and blood orange. It's rather lean and diluted, with bracing acidity.",Grifalco 2014 Frà Rosato (Basilicata)
An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.,Madrigal 2012 Las Viñas del Señor Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Pronounced notes of butter, cheese and canned cream corn dominate this savory Chardonnay. It's a rather fat, cream-textured wine but sunny tangerine acidity and fresher notes of apple and pear flavors do get a peek through the midpalate.",Millbrook 2013 Proprietor's Special Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region)
"Aromas of corn and melon are waxy and oily. This feels pinched and juicy, but not crisp or minerally. Stalky flavors of corn, citrus and apple lean towards bitter, as does the finish.",Santa Rita 2014 Medalla Real Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Leyda Valley)
"Aromas like green apples and lemons, and herbal flavors make this wine refreshing and balanced toward the lean side. It's rather light bodied and crisp in texture.",Scotto Family Cellars 2012 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"After 34 months in previously used French barrels, this wine has a brownish rim. It smells like pepper, clove and cinnamon and tastes like dried fruit. Considerable tannins contribute to an astringent mouthfeel.",Spicy Vines 2011 Sacrlet's Flirtation Zinfandel (Mendocino)
"This Meritage is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Tasting quite ripe, it has a burnt sage and cedar undertone. Tannins hit on the back of the palate with power and not much finesse.",Kirkland Signature 2012 Meritage (Napa Valley)
"This fresh wine has plenty of acidity as well as some firm tannins. It is still young, waiting to fill out with riper fruit flavors. The aftertaste just repeats the acidity.",Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2014 La Tour du Gouverneur  (Bordeaux)
"With the pale color of onion skin, this rosé has muted aromas of damp earth and dried rose petal. The lean, diluted palate reveals suggestions of red berry alongside brisk acidity.",Nugnes 2014 Rosato (Campania)
"The aromas of cinnamon, kelp, and dried fruit are unusual and don't seem in harmony. The gamy flavors bring some appeal but don't entirely come together.",Barnard Griffin 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This lean red initially opens with a sulfur aroma that burns off to reveal steeped prune, dried violet and a hint of resin. The diluted, fleeting palate offers hints of black cherry and walnut skin.",Cantine Grasso 2013 Caporosso Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Lean and tannic, this wine has chocolate and bitter coffee flavors from over-extraction. The fruit is suppressed at this stage, with a bitter aftertaste.",Château les Lattes 2013  Médoc
"Blocky, stewy, raisiny aromas of nonspecific black fruits are jumbled and green. This feels awkward and jammy, with little to no structural integrity. Flavors of prune, raisin and oak finish soft and loamy.",Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Carmenère (Central Valley)
"Coffee grinds and caramel mingle with hints of popcorn and dried herbs in this curious blend of white grapes which have been aged Sherry-style in a solera. Whiffs of dried fruit and caramel are enticing, but the palate juxtaposes craggy acidity with mouthfeel that's dampening and flat.",Ports of New York NV Meleau White Specialty Wine White (New York)

"The focus of this full, rounded, soft Pinot Blanc is on the pear flavors. The mineral texture is about easy-drinking freshness allied to attractive acidity.",Winkler-Hermaden 2007 Steierische Klassik Weissburgunder (Südoststeiermark)
"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.",Fire Block 2004 Old Vine Shiraz (Clare Valley)
"The White Fox is a refreshing, crisp white that offers a balance of acidity, spice and creamy pear flavors. There's body and the wine has weight without being heavy, its lemon acidity keeping it aloft.",Palivou 2006 White Fox Roditis (Corinth)
"Manfred Felsner obviously enjoys the spicy character of Grüner Veltliner, because, like all his wines from this varietal, this has spice in spades. But it also has good fresh acidity, which emphasizes the green fruit character of the wine, bringing out the crispness of the year. Screwcap.",Felsner 2007 Rohrendorfer Leithen Alte Reben Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Old vine Petite Sirah fortified with brandy in the Port style, this very sweet wine could benefit from some time in the bottle.

"The bone-dry, earthy minerality of Assyrtiko blends well with the crisp, fresh fruit flavors of Sauvignon Blanc in this white blend. Clean, simple flavors of citrus, spice and slate give the wine a quaffable, food-friendly edge.",Tsantali 2006 Ambelonas at Agios Pavlos White (Halkidiki)

"Simple peach aromas characterize this Prosecco Dry with a creamy, frothy cap, pretty bubbling and measured aromas of fruit salad and kiwi. The wine comes alive in the mouth thanks to its pretty mineral tones and generous fruity sweetness: Made from late-harvest Prosecco grapes.",Col Saliz NV Servo Suo Dry Vendemmia Tardiva  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)

"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. “Pulpy” is another descriptor.",Trapiche 2007 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Despite weighing in at 12% alcohol, this seems light in body and sweet in style, with honeyed pineapple aromas and flavors of apple skin and lime. Finishes stridently, with a dusty texture.",Louis Guntrum 2006 Niersteiner Bergkirche Kabinett Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"A little heavy and ripe for a Pinot Noir, this bottling shows pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries and currants, with a candied chocolate-covered mint sweetness. It also seems overly soft. Drink now.",Pali 2006 Durell Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Stemmler's record is spotty with this bottling. This '05 is a little too ripe, soft and heavy, but the chocolate-inspired red currant, cola and licorice flavors are lip-smackingly good.",Robert Stemmler 2005 Nugent Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.",Rutini 2006 Trumpeter Merlot (Mendoza)

It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.",Beresford 2014 Beacon Hill Sauvignon Blanc (South Australia)

"Leathery aromas of horseradish and stewed berries lead to a rooty, syrupy palate. Flavors of cola, chocolate and raisin are creamy as a whole.

"Truffle, underbrush, new leather and chopped herb aromas slowly emerge in the glass.

Drink 2023–2033.",Poderi Colla 2013 Bussia Dardi Le Rose  (Barolo)
"Old vines, many up to 80-years-old, supply the grapes that were fermented in traditional granite lagars for a ripe jammy character in this powerful wine.

"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard.

"Dark purple flowers and tart boysenberry paste show on the nose of this intensely concentrated wine, alongside pencil shavings, bay lead and a lot of iron minerality.

"Dark and deep aromas of black cherry, clove, allspice, black pepper and char make for a hearty impression on this appellation blend.

A rocky minerality and minty finish complete the experience.",Westerly 2013 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)

"This estate whose name means four winds is in the Douro Superior, the easternmost part of the Douro region.

"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines.

"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well.

It's light in mouthfeel and weight, but well structured.",Point & Line 2015 Reserve Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This producer specializes in seeking out parcels of old vines. In this case, the vines, planted at high density, have unusually crooked trunks. The wine itself, richly tannic and dense, has new wood flavors, ripe black-plum fruits and a dark firm character. It is still young and will develop into an impressively rich wine. Drink from 2019.",Secret Spot Wines 2014 Crooked Vines Colheita Red (Douro)

"Yes, it has 2003 ripeness, but there is also some restraint here. The tannins are still defiantly young, the fruit packed with black plum jelly flavors. It promises 2–3 years' aging.",Château la Grande Barthe 2003  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"Here is a solid, widely distributed, well-priced, all-purpose Chardonnay. It's got plenty of buttery toast, soft and round fruit—lightly peachy—and unusual richness for a wine in this price range.

The barrel flavors dominate, complemented by bold black cherry, blackberry and cassis fruit.",Sol Duc 2005 Goose Ridge Estate Vineyard Meritage Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Cabernet Sauvignon-dominated, the blend also includes about one third Merlot and a splash of Syrah. Tight and somewhat reductive when first opened, it slowly unwraps into a substantial effort, dense with berry, cherry and cassis concentrate. Some not-quite-integrated green tannins remain, and the buttery finish also wants more bottle age. But a good effort overall.",Horan Estates 2005 HVH Red Blend Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Spice, cherry cola and dried lavender emerge from the nose of this classy Riserva. The wine has elegance, harmony and a long finish thanks to the quality of its fruit and the natural acidity. Pair it with lasagna or meat-filled ravioli.",Lamole di Lamole 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)

"The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand.",Washington Hills 2006 Chardonnay (Washington)

"Opens with peachy, citric and saline aromas. Feels moderately fresh, but seems as though it's starting to mature as it's fleshy and pithy. Flavors of nectarine, orange and bitter pith are good but lack that ethereal quality that can make Albariño special. Drink now.",Lusco 2010 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.",Markham 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Whoa... need... water. Michael David's Earthquake is all about impact, no bones about it. And this one won't disappoint people who like their wine like finely aged Scotch, high in alcohol.

"Rugged and astringent in texture, with jammy blackberry and spice flavors.",Petroni 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)

"On the plus side, the wine is exotic and different, with blueberry, herbal notes, juniper and roasted aromas. But in the mouth, it's lean to the point of being thin, with sharp acidity and tight red plum, pie cherry and herbal flavors. Short on the finish, with tang and scour.",Bodegas Peñafiel 2006 Miros de Ribera Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)

"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes. It's a heavy, honey-soaked style, perhaps due to grapes that were affected by botrytis.

"This mix of 62% Pepper Bridge Vineyard Syrah and 38% Klipsun Vineyard Malbec has not entirely come together.

For the moment, give it a good decanting, or wait a couple more years before opening.",Flying Trout 2010 Cutthroat Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Bonterra's first rosé, showing the clean purity and balance that nearly always characterize its wines. Bone dry and vibrant in acidity, this Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Grenache blend has tart cherry, raspberry, tea and vanilla flavors. You might want to open it early to let some sulfur blow off.",Bonterra 2007 Rosé (Mendocino County)

"This austere and lightly herbal Cabernet is balanced and varietal, but at first seems a bit dull, as if tasted through a screen.

"A good but awkward attempt at a bigger, more saturated, more serious wine. The nose tells you that it's ripe, but there's some reduction in there too.

"This is richer than most Pinot Grigios. It opens with aromas of toast, yellow flower, vanilla and a balsamic note while the round, full-bodied palate offers baked yellow apple, candied lemon drop, nectarine zest and almond.

"This is an unusual commingling of mostly Rhone varieties, a mix of 75% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 12% Marsanne, with the addition of 3% Sémillon. Honeycomb and Nilla wafer rise from the nose before a medium-bodied swirl of sour lemon, grapefruit and yuzu give it tartness on the finish.",Martin Ray 2014 The Tower White (Dry Creek Valley)
"This big but balanced wine has melon and apple aromas, lots of fruit and toasty oak in the flavors, and a super-smooth and rich texture. The finish lingers.",Matchbook 2014 Old Head Chardonnay (Dunnigan Hills)
"Grapefruit, peach and nectarine aromas carry over to the racy palate along with apricot. Zesty acidity provides refreshing balance and a tangy finish.",Nals Margreid 2014 Kerner (Alto Adige)
"This linear wine opens with aromas that suggest tomato vine, white spring flower and yellow grapefruit that carry over to the crisp palate along with a hint of zesty lemon peel. Racy acidity adds even more verve.",Nals Margreid 2014 Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Opaque and thick, this soft, black peppery wine is ripe and bright in clove, crisp red currant and cranberry, with a streak of eucalyptus-like mint. It finishes in a subtle flourish of cedar and tar.",Paratus 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Aromas of pressed apples and pears turn fleshier and riper on the palate of this forward, concentrated Riesling. Sumptuous peach and apricot flavors amass a honeyed sweetness on the midpalate, balanced neatly by squirts of tangerine acidity. It's an approachable, fruity wine to drink now through 2017.",Peter Mertes 2014 Platinum Riesling (Mosel)
"The dark color and high acidity of this wine are both typical of the Sousão grape which is normally found only in Douro blends. It is ripe, fruity and juicy although with tight acidity and black currant fruits. The wine's tannins suggest it needs to age, so drink from 2017.",Quinta do Vallado 2013 Sousão (Douro)
"The balance between wood aging and fruit is at its best in this wine. It shows plenty of red fruits filled out with raisins and nutmeg. As a contrast the wood aging has brought out a spicy, almond character. It is fresh, on the dry side for an aged tawny and, of course, ready to drink.",Quinta dos Murças NV 10 Anos Old Tawny  (Port)
"While big and brawny in style, this Pinot still maintains good balance. The aromas resemble toasty, spicy oak, with cranberry and dark cherry notes. The flavors echo the nose and are vivid due to lively acidity and a firm layer of tannins.",Replica 2014 Pinot Noir (California)
"Big, full bodied and concentrated, this is a ripe, rich wine. Ripe plum flavors are balanced with nervy acidity and dense tannins. This is a wine that will still need to age, so don't drink before 2017.",Domaine de l'Hermitage 2010 Red (Bandol)
"This is a remarkably spicy wine that is also finely balanced. It's sophisticated as well as rich, with spice and lychee flavors lifted by a crisp edge of acidity. It's complex in texture and should age well. Drink from 2015.",Domaine Weinbach 2011 Cuvée Théo Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This is a medium-sweet wine that's warm and rich due to the ripening abilities of the Spiegel vineyard. It is spiced, concentrated and full of a smoky character that contrasts with its fruitiness. It's ready to drink now, although it will certainly age well. Drink until 2019.",Domaines Schlumberger 2007 Spiegel Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices.",Dry Creek Vineyard 2011 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge.",Dunham 2010 XVI Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Richly aromatic, on the strength of the nose alone this could pass for something from Napa's Rutherford Bench. The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way. Strikingly dense and complex, with decades of life ahead.",Tamarack Cellars 2009 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Reserve Red (Red Mountain)
"Sourced entirely from the Sagemoor vineyard, this richly endowed Viognier smothers the palate in a lush mix of fat, candied citrus and tropical fruits. Honeysuckle and orange pekoe tea flavors trickle into the lingering, lip-smacking finish.",Tamarack Cellars 2012 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sweet and rich, this is a wine that combines honey with a touch of toast and smokiness. The mid palate is filled with apricot and fresh lemon flavors. There is a fine acidity on the finish that gives a delicious lift.",Trimbach 2007 Vendanges Tardives Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Alluring white-pepper spice, with nuances of dried thyme and seductive cherry fruit, make this a compelling choice with more depth than force. This is subtle and velvety, quietly convincing and very long. Firm yet ripe tannins provide structure and ageability. This will be even more elegant with a few years of cellaring; drink 2016–2020.",Krutzler 2011 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.",Marita's Vineyard 2007 SOMA Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Sourced principally from Klipsun, with smaller amounts from Champoux and Seven Hills, this tight, dark, richly-flavored wine has impeccable credentials. Black fruits, espresso and citrus—notably blood orange—mingle seamlessly, though it takes some hours to open up. The Red Mountain fruit contributes characteristic notes of iron ore and underlying minerality.",Pamplin 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Red cherry fruit, with edges of white pepper, plays charmingly on both the nose and palate. The svelte figure of the wine belies its depth: this has subtle, Burgundian virtues and earthy undertones that provoke stimulating conversation and thought. An ideal accompaniment for subtle, nuanced dishes or a really good book.",Prieler 2010 Blaufränkisch (Leithaberg)
"This is a textured wine with ripe and perfumed fruitiness. Honeyed in style and medium-sweet on the palate, it's a complex, rich wine that's ready to drink now, but could also improve with age.",Rieflé 2010 Steinert Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Richly sweet, this is a wine that has traded primary fruitiness with deliciously balanced honey flavor and lively citrus acidity. It's a wine that has richness, intense flavor and the ability to age further.",Rieflé 2010 Zinnkoepflé Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.",Rocca 2010 Collinetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"The 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon is upfront, with Syrah providing an accent. It's tightly wound, with notes of dusty cherry, sautéed herbs and spices, and tart cranberries supported by chewy, firm tannins that need time in the cellar to come into their own. Best after 2017.",Buty 2010 Columbia Rediviva Phinny Hill Vineyard Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Caldwell managed to wrest plenty of blackberry and cherry fruit into this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, even though the vintage was a tough one. The wine, aged in 80% new French oak, is elaborate and opulent, but the tannins are strong, giving the palate a lockdown astringency. It should age well though and your window of drinking begins in 2019.",Caldwell 2011 Silver Red (Napa Valley)
"This brings bracing minerality into the forefront, in a terroir-driven wine with excellent penetration and depth. A fresh mix of citrus and stone, this elevates Viognier into the top echelons of Washington white wines.",Charles Smith 2012 Stoneridge Vineyard Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Firm and tannic in structure, this is a wine for aging. Ripe, dark fruits add power and a density of texture. Drink from 2016.",Château Paradis 2010 Terre des Anges Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Structured and firm, this is a tight wine with powerful, youthful acidity as well as a dense structure and dark tannins. It has weight as well, indicating a wine with excellent aging potential. Drink from 2016.",Château Salettes 2011 Red (Bandol)
"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot, this is a dense and brooding wine, with dark notes of cassis, licorice, black plum, date and cigar-box spice on the nose and in the mouth. The palate is firmly structured, with medium tannins and balanced alcohol that lend the wine a crushed-velvet texture. Glimmers of charred oak and toasted spice linger long on the finish. Delicious now, but should develop more layer and nuance with time; drink through 2018.",Kanonkop 2008 Paul Sauer Red (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)
"The 2010 Bello Rosso sticks to the 50-50 Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon formula, with a full, round, ripe and balanced palate. Fruity and forward, with citrus-accented cherry fruit, it pulls together the strengths of both grapes, with taut acidity and firm tannins.",Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Bello Rosso Cabernet Sauvignon-Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This sources grapes from the oldest (1972) blocks at Sagemoor, yielding a deep, rich and intense wine saturated with black cherry, cassis, licorice and barrel flavors. It's perfectly balanced, drinking beautifully, and fit for cellaring over a decade or longer.",Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dense and structured, this is a wine with good potential. It has weight, concentrated tannins and ripe fruit, as well as a solid, full-bodied feel. The palate is marked with power, a fine mineral texture and great acidity on the finish. Drink from 2017.",Domaine de Val d'Arenc 2011 Red (Bandol)
"A hint of mossy undergrowth leads on the nose, while lovely notes of white-pepper dusted green and yellow pear unfold on the soft, rounded palate. Those looking for texture as well as flavor will not be disappointed. Those who have the patience to cellar this will be rewarded with complex, mature flavors and great concentration. Drink 2016–2020.",Domäne Wachau 2012 Achleiten Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"This is the first vintage for Upright—100% Klipsun Vineyard and 100% varietal Merlot. Thick and syrupy, it's a full throttle wine, with deep flavors of berry, cherry and cassis. Red licorice lightly streaks through the back end, and the wine makes a smooth landing on a strip of Bourbon barrel notes.",Efeste 2010 Upright Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (Red Mountain)
"Sourced from a vineyard high up in the Mayacamas, on the Sonoma County side, this wine is intense with mountain grown fruit. The palate is full of ripe black currants, mocha and plenty of toasty oak. The tannins, while soft and pliant, are penetrating. All indications are of a wine that wants time in the cellar. Drink from 2016 till well beyond.",Ferrari-Carano 2008 PreVail Back Forty Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Very subtle but ultimately seductive wild cherry notes captivate on the nose, while the body is luscious, rounded, generous and inviting, without an ounce of fat. There are hints of clove and anise, a deep, mellow cherry core and haunting floral hints. Drink 2015–2020.",Fritsch 2011 'P' Pinot Noir (Wagram-Donauland)
"Brooding flavors of dark cherry and pure cocoa initially play on the palate, but it slowly opens up to reveal a deceptive lightness. The body is sleek yet concentrated, with super-soft tannins. With haunting edges of cherries preserved in kirsch and bitter chocolate, this is an intriguing, elegant wine that's lovely now but will also age gracefully through 2019.",Judith Beck 2011 Pannobile Red (Burgenland)
"Dark and thick in the glass, this blend of 82% Syrah and 18% Mourvèdre leads with black cherry syrup, smoked beef and dark chocolate aromas, which blossom as the wine opens. Rich and lavish on the palate, it has fine tannins that frame its blueberry, cassis and mocha flavors. It's firmly structured, with a lingering acidity.",Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Authenticity Red (Paso Robles)
"A partnership between the Delicato Family and country musician Zac Brown, this well-made wine shows a wealth of flavor and complexity, from dusty saddle and earth to black cherry and berry. Muscular and dense, it reveals plenty of underlying structure and grace, with a bright sprinkling of spicy pepper on the finish. Drink ideally between 2020 and 2023.",Z. Alexander Brown 2013 Limited Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
Bouscassé is the home of Alain Brumont who also owns Château Montus in Madiran. This powerful wine with its blend of Tannat with the two Cabernets (Franc and Sauvignon) is dense and packed with firm tannins. It is also equally full of generous black-plum fruits and considerable acidity. This is still young—it's a concentrated wine that needs to age further. Drink from 2019.,Alain Brumont 2011 Château Bouscassé Red (Madiran)
"Crisp and packed with lively lemon-like acidity, this wine shows both minerality and intense fruitiness. Textured and tight, it has hints of yellow fruit in the background that will blossom as the wine develops. Drink from 2021.",Alex Gambal 2014 La Maltroie Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"This deeply impressive blend of 20 different varieties comes from a vineyard at the top of the Gaivosa estate that was oddly ignored for many years. With black plum fruit, dense tannins and intense acidity, it's built for longterm aging. Drink from 2021.",Alves de Sousa 2013 Abandonado Red (Douro)
"2014 proves another banner year for this delightful blend of Sémillon from Monte Rosso Vineyard, Muscadelle from Pagani Ranch and Palomino and Muscadelle from Saitone Ranch. High-toned in tart, refreshing acidity, it offers hints of vanilla biscuit with its lime, apple and melon flavors, lingering in memory for days.",Carlisle 2014 The Derivative White (Sonoma County)
"Purists will no doubt object to this wine's fine patina of sophisticated, cedary oak, but there's plenty of high-quality fruit to back it up. Incorporating unusual proportions of 44% Grenache, 33% Mourvèdre and 23% Syrah, the fruit is ripe and lush, velvety-supple and medium to full in weight, without any sense of heaviness. Drink 2020–2030.",Château La Nerthe 2013 Cuvée des Cadettes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"From one of the highest premier cru vineyards comes a wine that has a cool edge, generous fruit and firm tannins. Those elements come together with black cherry flavors and a dry core, promising a serious future. Drink from 2023.",David Duband 2014 Aux Thorey Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"This wine manages to combine firm structure with the finely perfumed fruit associated with Chambolle-Musigny. It's rich, fruity, lifted by acidity and held together by solid tannins. Impressive and full bodied, it's a wine to age. Drink from 2024.",David Duband 2014 Les Sentiers Premier Cru  (Chambolle-Musigny)
"Underbrush, truffle, crushed herb and ripe black-skinned fruit aromas slowly take shape along with a waft of new leather. The bold palate shows mature black cherry, licorice, clove and tobacco framed in big velvety tannins. This is already tempting but will be even better in a few years. Drink 2020–2027.",Le Ragnaie 2012 Fornace  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This dense and structured wine comes from a small walled vineyard within the larger Les Vignes Franches premier cru, partially owned by Louis Jadot. Robust tannins frame its rich, juicy black fruit, showing potential for long aging. Drink from 2024.",Louis Jadot 2014 Clos des Ursules Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Baked plum, baking spice, blue flower and pipe tobacco meld together with earthy aromas of new leather and a whiff of underbrush on this impressive wine. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, dark chocolate and star anise. Firm velvety tannins envelope the palate. Drink 2019–2029.",Masi 2009 Campolongo di Torbe  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"The winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah. It offers black licorice, smoked meat, baked black cherry and graphite aromas, needing time to breathe before unleashing black coffee, elderberry jam, asphalt and charcoal flavors through tarry tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",Epoch Estate Wines 2013 Ingenuity Red (Paso Robles)
"From a 22-acre site in the middle of the appellation, this is an impressive wine, softened by the addition of 6% Merlot. It boasts crushed rock, black currant and licorice flavors, with an attractive sanguine note. Pencil shavings, black pepper and cigar accents are present throughout.",Freemark Abbey 2013 Cabernet Bosché Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gewächs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least.",Fritz Haag 2015 Brauneberg Juffer Sonnenuhr Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)
"Named after the 15th century owner of this estate, the wine comes from a selection of the best parcels. With impressive tannins, a dense structure and rich bold black fruits, this is a powerful wine. It is full of ripe fruit with a mineral texture and has a good future. Drink from 2021.",Georges Vigouroux 2014 Château de Haute-Serre Cuvée Géron Dadine de Haute-Serre Malbec (Cahors)
"This wine from Rick Grimm and winemaker Paul Lato shows stunning potential for this new vineyard. Blackberry, thyme, black pepper and crushed slate aromas lead to a tremendously savory, umami-packed palate, where bay leaf and stewed mushroom notes envelop a core of blackberry and black currant fruit. The structure is solid, and the finish is long and strong.",Grimm's Bluff 2014 Cliff Hanger Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"At first shy and brooding, this slowly opens up in the glass, offering aromas of black-skinned berry, blue flower, licorice and flint. The palate has concentration and finesse, boasting chewy black cherry, blackberry, chopped mint, anise and mineral alongside firm acidity and lithe tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017–2023.",Foradori 2013 Morei Teroldego (Vigneti delle Dolomiti)
"This is a standout, showing Napa Valley's true potential for the variety. Steely and light bodied in approach, it offers a lively complement of apricot and juicy green-apple flavors, finishing on a fresh fig note and feeling balanced and complete.",Joseph Phelps 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (St. Helena)
"Aromas of forest floor, baked plum, clove and a balsamic whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers fleshy wild cherry, raspberry, star anise, tobacco and nutmeg alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2018–2024.",Le Ragnaie 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"This wine comes from a vineyard owned by the Gagey situated in the northern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Romanée. It has firm structure and a perfumed character that is already enticing. Richly fruity with juicy acidity, it will be impressive as it ages. Drink from 2023.",Louis Jadot 2014 Les Boudots Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"From a warm-climate zone in a cool vintage, this wine is fascinatingly savory. Black and white pepper, game meat, crushed graphite and espresso aromas promise an awesome sip. It delivers with black peppercorn, green olive, black plum skin and elderberry flavors.",Mesa Del Sol 2011 Syrah (Arroyo Seco)
"From the historic Herdade do Mouchão in northern Alentejo, this is a powerful wine, full of dense tannins and impressively ripe, juicy black fruits. Syrah and Alicante Bouschet bring southern richness to Touriga Franca and Touriga Nacional. Drink this wine now.",Mouchão 2012 Ponte das Canas Red (Alentejo)
"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity.",Pine Ridge 2013 Fortis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Plump but sour cranberry fruit aromas meet with sweet sandalwood, clove and forest floor on the nose of this San Francisco-made bottling from the historic property. Sanguine touches on the palate lead to raspberry, cherry, cinnamon and juniper flavors, ending in a menthol finish.",Sandler 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak. Tar and graphite scents and bold, soft acidity support juicy black and red berry flavors, with a shock of anise. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",Sixteen by Twenty 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From an estate vineyard, this impressive wine is earthy with tobacco leaf and juicy cherry and cassis notes. Soft, supple and lengthy, it lingers on the palate as a well-integrated, balanced and beautifully crafted expression of the grape.",Stone The Crows 2014 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.",Tolosa 2015 Hollister Edna Ranch Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Mature plum, ripe berry, baking spice, underbrush and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. On the chewy palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth to dried cherry and raspberry. Velvety tannins give it just enough tension and texture. Drink 2018–2024.",Villa Poggio Salvi 2011 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's muscular and lushly layered, with spicy leather and tobacco notes accented by a delicate touch of violet and supported by firm, grippy tannin. Drink now through 2033.",Volker Eisele Family Estate 2013 Sievers Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"There's no shortage of heavily charred oak, and early on it may seem a bit mulchy and leathery. But as it knits together and the fruit rises, you'll see that there's a compact, serious wine laying in wait. Flavors of blackberry, licorice and herbs are authentic and powerful. Clacky tannins make food almost mandatory.",TerraNoble 2006 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Sagrantino is a simple, fruit-forward wine with loads of red cherry, blueberry, cedar wood and exotic spice. It has a gritty, spicy mouthfeel and big, powerful tannins.",Terre de Trinci 2003 Riserva  (Montefalco Rosso)
"Opens with a pretty shade of gold that denotes more sophisticated extraction and in fact that impression is carried through to the nose and mouth where the wine exhibits ripe fruity aromas, honey, almond skin, dried herbs and natural rubber. The mouthfeel is thin, but remains a step above the commercial Pinot Grigio that is so commonly available. The wine is packaged with a real vine clipping around the bottle neck.",Mosolo Gleni 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat. It's got a pretty, fruity entry and a substantial, slightly earthy finish; it's just that midpalate that falls a bit short.",Arbor Crest 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A solid wine with a good mix of herbal, cola and red-fruit aromas. It deals spanking red fruit flavors and a sprinkle of vanilla and chocolate on the racy finish. For a short, fresh and clean wine, Aresti's Cab makes the grade.",Aresti 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Rio Claro)
"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value.",Wolf Blass 2005 Yellow Label Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"Big, bold, wild and dark, with mild burnt aromas backed by broad blackberry and plum flavors. This represents the fruity, thick style of Syrah, with additional notes of black olive and savory meat pie. It's not flawless but its pounding fruit character will earn its share of fans.",Chilensis 2006 Reserva Syrah (Maule Valley)
"Pungent and sharp, and that's exactly the style that Los Vascos has mastered in recent years. This wine tastes very much like a coastal, Casablanca Chardonnay yet it hails from Colchagua. The nose is pithy and citric, and the palate is more of the same. Good mouthfeel and fresh, but green, citrusy and too much like Sauvignon Blanc.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2007 Los Vascos Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"With quite a bit of residual sugar, this Riesling is sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity that makes it clean and zesty. The flavors are of peaches, apricots, candied ginger, honeysuckle and vanilla. Low alcohol makes it easy to drink.",Fetzer 2006 Valley Oaks Riesling (California)
"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.",Finca Sophenia 2006 Altosur Cabernet Sauvignon (Tupungato)
"A light wine, somewhat unfocused and lacking fruit intensity. But it is certainly pleasant, clean and fresh, with a definite green tinge and a citrus aftertaste.",Fournier Père et Fils 2006 Fournier  (Menetou-Salon)
"Shows plenty of weight on the palate, but also an overall lack of intensity to its slightly vegetal—green pea—flavors. Still, there's enough passion fruit and grapefruit to provide a sense of balance and a crisp, clean finish.",Barker's Marque 2007 Arona Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",Beringer 2004 Bancroft Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"The rich, spicy and savory nose evoke the food for which the country is known, and this wine would undoubtedly pair well with full-bodied, spiced meats and stews. Its full, spicy nose leads into dependable flavors of red berry, wooded spice and pepper, with a slightly bitter, smoked edge. Not a terribly complex wine, but solid and tasty nonetheless.",Bock 2000 Cuvée Barrique Red (Villány)
"Shows a beautiful Pinotesque mouthfeel, all silk and satin, with that elegant Carneros acidity. But the flavors could be more concentrated. The cherries, cola and pomegranates feel a little watered down.",Carneros Creek 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This is a bold and powerful wine with distinctive green notes that recall dried grass, black pepper and spice. It also has bitter chocolate, cardamom and cumin and its tannins are so strong, they literally leave your palate parched and dry.",Casale Triocco 2003  Sagrantino di Montefalco
"Here's a delicate, feminine Sangiovese with a thin consistency and mature aromas of forest berry, raspberry, black olive and spice. It's a bit thorny in places with sour notes on the finish but it would pair well with pasta or pizza.",Castello di Monastero 2004 Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Offers herb, cranberry and cherry aromas upfront, followed by a medium-bodied palate that's cedary and herbal, but also shows some chunky cherry fruit. Finishes on oaky notes of coffee and chocolate.",Konrad 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Here's a lean, almost colorless, citrus-driven Grigio from sunny Umbria that has a bit of candy and cola on its sweet, fragrant nose. There are peppermint renderings and dried hay in the background. It's watery and lean in the mouth and would pair with appetizers or simple vegetable dishes.",Lungarotti 2006 Pinot Grigio Pinot Grigio (Umbria)
"A soft, easy-to-drink Pinot Noir—even for Marlborough. Tannins are developed and supple, while the flavors lean toward caramel, cherry and sandalwood. Drink now.",Mana 2006 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.",Michel Torino 2007 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley)
"Made from authentic Port varieties, this dessert wine is quite sweet. The residual sugar is about 9.5%, giving a honeyed finish to the blackberry and chocolate flavors. It doesn't have the complexity for aging, so drink now.",Robert Hall 2005 Vintage Port Port (Paso Robles)
"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a splash of Cabernet Sauvignon, this tannic, dry wine has flavors of cherries, vanilla and smoky oak. It may develop some additional complexities over time.",Rubissow 2004 Trompettes Red (Mount Veeder)
"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.",Santa Julia 2007 Organica Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Timing is everything with this full-bodied PG. Get at it right away and it will still be almost viscous, but it should also show ripe tropical fruit flavors, core acidity and lots of personality. Just don't let it hang around for long, especially not at room temperature.",Santa Julia 2007 Pinot Grigio (Mendoza)
"This Pinot Grigio is a bit more fragrant and floral in essence with aromas of stone fruit and peach blossom. It has a fresh, almost piquant edge but it also has that characteristic watery mouthfeel you'll likely encounter with this variety.",Ronco Blanchis 2006 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"The oak on this wine gives it a strong resin and cinnamon character. Along the way there's floral berry aromas, cherry and plum flavors, and finishing notes of root beer, chocolate and cough drops. A bit woody and tannic but it gets the job done.",San Pedro 2006 Castillo de Molina Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
"Among the greatest expressions of Fiano, Cometa is a full and generous effort, with deep layers of passion fruit and stone fruit, plus touches of vanilla, honey and light spice.

"Really easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish.

The fruit is sourced from the cool, southern part of the Russian River Valley.",Small Vines 2010 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Despite the problematic vintage, this wine opens with bold aromatic intensity, featuring notes of prune, plum, blackberry and spice. On the palate, the wine is structured and firm, with a touch of sweet cherry on the finish.",Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sicilia)

"Made using fruit from one of the top Kamptal vineyards, this perfumed wine has great texture, with tight acidity and notes of green plum skin and lemon zest.

"Made using fruit sourced from a parcel of vines more than 60 years old, this is a dense, dark wine, with herb, dark fig and plum notes. Solid and concentrated, it has a firm texture, and the dusty tannins match well with the ripe fruit. Age for 7–8 years.",Château de Gaudou 2009 Réserve Caillou Malbec (Cahors)

"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring. The wine is rich with a sweet blackberry flavor, with lots of new French oak. The tannins are hard, reminiscent of an older era of Napa Cabernet. Give it 5–6 years, but anything longer than that and the fruit may be threatened.",Charles Krug 2009 Vintage Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"The nose is an attractive mix of cassis and mineral notes. The palate is more racy and wiry than dense and soft, with juicy, flashy flavors of berry, cherry and currant.

The wine is concentrated and rich, with heady notes of dark cherry, cinnamon and clove, plus a trace of mint hiding in the background. This will please fans of California and Bordeaux wines.",Steven Kent 2009 The Premier Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Aromas of acacia, mature apple, hazelnut and an unusual balsamic note lead the nose. The palate is already evolved and has lost most of its fruit richness and freshness, offering instead honeyed mineral, toasted nut and a hint of dried citrus peel.",Hauner 2015 Hierà Rosé (Terre Siciliane)

"The Mottet family bought this chateau in 2009 and has been in renovation mode: chateau, winery, vast vineyards and placement of a dramatic 40-foot steel rooster in the vineyard.

"Melon, wood spice and vanilla aromas are common for this level of Chilean Chardonnay. A plump palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of pear, oak and skins-based bitterness. A woody tasting finish is adequate.",Rubus 2016 Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)

Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",Quilceda Creek 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A stupendous Pinot Noir, showing how beautifully this vineyard performs in the remote Sonoma Coast above Fort Ross. Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it. Now–2021.",Williams Selyem 2009 Precious Mountain Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A massive wine for Margaux, packed with tannins and ripe fruit.

"A stunning Pirouette—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Merlot, 9% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Full and magnificently rich, it is loaded with dense and thrilling fruit flavors of black cherry and cassis.

"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",JCB 2009 No. 1 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"A drop-dead gorgeous Pinot Noir that will satisfy everyone from Burgundy fans to diehard Cabernet cultists.

"Just across the road from Pétrus, la Fleur-Pétrus shares some of the same intensity. There is great fruit here, rounded and powerful with the ripest character. It is open, generous, ready to drink. The tannins lead into the purest acidity, letting the fruit sing.",Château la Fleur-Pétrus 2009  Pomerol
"A dense, immense, solidly powerful wine. The ripest fruit overflows, paralleling the dark, solid tannins. As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential.",Château Lynch-Bages 2009  Pauillac
"A huge Cabernet, in the best sense of the word. It wasn't the easiest vintage, as 2007 was, but meticulous winemaking did the job, resulting in this amazingly rich, impressively ripe wine that's drinkable now and will develop for many years. The fruits veer toward blackberries, cherries and cola, and the tannins are soft and refined. One hundred percent new French oak isn't at all heavy, lending nuances of buttered toast and sweet wood tannins. Will easily age for 15 years.",Groth 2008 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors. The tannins are so enveloped by the fruit and yet they promise great aging.

"Beneath the surface tannins is great Merlot fruit, very ripe and full-bodied, a powerhouse of flavors. The depth and complexity of the wine is all there, along with a dark core of dryness. A wine for long-term aging.",Château Trotanoy 2009  Pomerol
"A triumph, one of the greatest Riverblock bottings in years. This always is a captivating wine, but the '09 is particularly scrumptious. Although it's quite tannic and acidic, it's forward enough in raspberries, cherries and cola to enjoy now. But it's bone dry and as elegant as California Pinot Noir gets. The balance suggests an ability to age for a good 10 years, if not longer.",Williams Selyem 2009 Rochioli Riverblock Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

"A sip is all it takes to fall in love with this potent Pinot Noir.

"Certainly the finest Grand Ciel Syrah to date, this is a full-flavored, complete wine, loaded with pure fruit flavors of berry and cassis. The details pile on—a whiff of stone, a hint of chocolate, suggestions of spice, all in perfect proportion.",Doyenne 2008 Grand Ciel Vineyard Syrah (Red Mountain)
"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",Hanzell 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"A blend of three vineyards, all estate, this is a sublime, viscous and somewhat briny wine that exhibits some oak on the nose.

"This wine enjoys the fruitiness of the vintage with its black-currant flavors and light tannic structure. The blend is 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc.

"This fresh wine has attractive citrus and yellow fruit flavors and an orange tang. It needs more time; drink from 2017. The property includes five acres of white grapes and 65 acres of red.

"Herbal and fruity at this young stage, this wine is bright with acidity, citrus fruits and a tangy texture.

"Bright and fruity, this is classic white Bordeaux with its citrus and lively acidity as well as a crisp texture. It has weight and shows some potential to fill out, so drink from 2017. Because of spring frost and summer rain, Marie-José (Perrin) Leriche reduced the (90%) Sauvignon Blanc and (10%) Sémillion harvest by a third.",Château le Sartre 2013  Pessac-Léognan
This wine is dry but rich enough with black-currant flavors to compensate. The juicy aftertaste suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2017. This wine is the latest result of renovations on the 15-generation and 400-year-old Trocard family estate.,Château Mancèdre 2013  Pessac-Léognan

"Made with Nero d'Avola and aged in wood, this unusual rosato opens with aromas that recall mature red fruit, cake spice, chopped sage, oak and a balsamic note.

"This medium-bodied wine is marked by dry, stony notes rather than a profusion of fruit. Subtle leafiness and hints of underripe melon give this a restrained aspect and suggest it's more of a food partner than a wine that will shine on its own.",Mills Reef 2014 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay)
Ripe peach and yellow cherry aromas take a turn towards the tropics on the palate of this intensely fruity wine. It's semi-dry in style with a slightly candied tone but balanced neatly by tart lemon­-lime acidity. Drink now.,Paumanok 2014 Semi Dry Riesling (North Fork of Long Island)
"This has value written all over it, offering fleshy, ripe tropical aromas and flavors. The personality is large and in charge, yet the wine itself remains reasonably balanced and firm in structure.",Broken Clouds 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Vanilla, coconut and toast aromas are vibrant and out-front, followed by tropical fruit. This wine is full bodied with a viscous, almost oily feel that persists through the finish. It offers some good things, but the variety gets lost in the style.",Browne Family Vineyards 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Mature plum, aromatic herb and a whiff of cocoa lead the nose. The dense palate offers toasted oak, blackberry extract and espresso alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm, drying finish.",Caruso & Minini 2012 Cutaja Riserva Nero d'Avola (Delia Nivolelli)
"The aromas of flowers and freshly cut pear, melon and starfruit are bright and fresh. This wine is dry and thick in feel with abundant citrus-rind flavors. There's enjoyment to be had but it gets bogged down in the middle.",Castillo De Feliciana 2014 Estate Vineyard Albariño (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",Château Amour 2013  Médoc
"This wine is still closed, lean and firm with its fruitiness masked by a strong mineral structure. It needs plenty of time to develop, so drink from 2018.",Château de Cruzeau 2013  Pessac-Léognan
"Still lean and structured, this is a cool-feeling, young wine. It has dry tannins and a chewy texture that needs to soften. At the back, juicy black currant fruits show promise for the future. Drink from 2018.",Château de Paillet-Quancard 2012  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"This is rich in spice, herbal characteristics and tangy acidity. It has a strongly mineral edge along with green fruits and tight lemon zest. Drink from 2017. André Lurton bought de Rochemorin in 1973; the estate has grown vines since the 16th century.",Château de Rochemorin 2013  Pessac-Léognan

"Aromas of dish soap and fruit salad show on the nose while the palate brings pink grapefruit and orange. A citric finish with a peppery note lacks acidity, so drink now.",Alta Vista 2016 Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.",Aymara 2015 Estate Torrontés (Maipú)
"This is a light bright wine, full of forward fruitiness. The tangy edge of minerality gives the wine a pleasing texture. Citrus fruits support this texture with their zest and acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",Paul Buisse 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"This light, cool-climate Pinot Noir is crisp with red currant fruit and herbal-tinged acidity. It has a zesty character that keeps it lively and tight. Drink now.",Saget la Perrière 2016 La Petite Perrière Pinot Noir (Vin de France)
"Popping with aromas of lychee, rose, geranium and violet this wine is quite perfumed. There are also citrus notes of lime zest and lemon curd. Flavors are perfumed and soapy as well, and it wine coats your mouth. The finish is long with a slightly bitter end.",The Williamsburg Winery 2015 A Midsummer Night's White White (Virginia)
"Lightly spicy raspberry aromas are raw and peppery. This feels fleshy and pulpy, with punchy acidity. Peppery berry flavors are boosted by toasty oak that carries over to a mildly hot finish.",Valentin Bianchi 2015 Sensual Malbec (Mendoza)
Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus. Aggressively frothy bubbles give way to cashews and bread dough showing hints of lemon. Grapefruit pith and peanut skin bring a slightly bitter note to the finish.,Gruet NV Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (America)
"This is an easy, open wine that is lightly herbal. There is a barnyard edge that masks the fruit, although there is bright crisp acidity to give it a lift. Drink now.",Jean-Max Roger 2015 Le Charnay  (Menetou-Salon)
"Named after the poppy that blooms in May in the Alentejo, this wine is juicy and fruity, with a light touch of tannins. It is all red berries, with an easygoing juicy character, Drink now.",Magnum Vinhos 2015 Flor de Maio Mayflower Red (Alentejano)
"Young and fruity, this is a bright and wine for immediate drinking. It has hints of tannins, plenty of red fruits and no wood.",Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2016 Brado Red (Alentejano)
"Powerful aromas of lychee, mango and peach give a vibrant feel tropical to this wine. These aromas show the palate and are joined by peach candies and rosewater. With decent acidity, this still feels viscous on the palate and has a medium finish that ends with ginger spice.",Blue Valley 2015 Muskat Ottonel (Middleburg)
"The sunshine of the Languedoc comes through in this wine's warm, soft fruit. A touch of acidity and a backdrop of tannins give it contrast and a fine, ready-to-drink character.",Vinadeis 2016 Le Val Merlot (Vin de France)
"Structured and with solid tannins, this is a wood- and spice-laden wine. Its fruit lies somewhere behind all this structure and is likely to remain there.",Wines & Winemakers 2014 Dona Helena Reserva Red (Península de Setúbal)
"This youthful pink-colored number smells of dusty cherry and Lifesavers. A juicy palate has a soda-like feel, while flavors of raspberry and cherry are light and dilute across the finish.",Zolo 2017 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Rosé (Mendoza)
A bit of charred wood and black pepper in the aroma give way to lush berry and cherry flavors that spread across the palate and cling to the sides of the mouth. This wine is lightly oaky and has an attractive richness that lasts on the finish.,Gnarly Head 2015 Pinot Noir (California)
"Tightly constructed for an entry-priced Chardonnay, this has faint almond nuttiness accenting pineapple and grapefruit flavors. Drink this medium-bodied wine through mid-2018.",Jacob's Creek 2016 Chardonnay (Australia)
"Full and ripe, this wine offers thick meaty flavors of pineapple and peach, finishing in sweet vanilla oak.",Ca' Momi 2015 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
This is a crisp cherry-flavored wine. Cool-climate Pinot Noir has a light texture that gives the wine a hint of tannins although it is much more about fruit and bright acidity. Drink now.,Domaine de Reuilly 2015 Pinot Noir (Reuilly)
"There are firm and dusty tannins in this spicy wine. It has firm fruit, a solid texture and a juicy, nutmeg-flavored aftertaste. Drink from 2018 when some of the tannins have softened.",Enoport 2014 Topázio Reserva Red (Douro)
"Tinta Miúda, known as the rare Graciano grape in Spain, is not often found in Portugal. Here it makes a ripe, juicy and jammy wine that's soft, with only a minimum of tannins to keep it together. It has a typically warm character and is ready to drink.",Fiuza 2015 Tinta Miúda Red (Tejo)
Substantial fruit flavors and a lightly sweet balance give this medium- bodied wine a decent drinkability factor. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and the finish is brief.,Tie-Dye 2014 Red (North Coast)
"This offers earthy aromas of game, tilled soil, leather and forest floor. The lean rustic palate offers suggestions of dried cherry, a hint of dark spice and a gamy note alongside firm acidity and dusty tannins.",Il Chiosso 2010  Gattinara
"A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture.",Grayson 2015 Lot 11 Chardonnay (California)
"With ripe, generic fruit flavors, a soft texture and slight sweetness, this is a very easygoing, easy-drinking, light-bodied wine.",Leaping Lizard 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Cherry cough drop and minerally, almost chlorine aromas lead to an edgy high-acid hard palate. This blend of Carignan, Garnacha and Syrah tastes medicinal and like creamy but fiery red plum. A screechy-feeling, chocolaty-tasting finish leaves an impression.",Portal del Montsant 2014 Bruberry Red (Montsant)
"Lime and tangerine aromas are light and dusty, with a yeasty note. This feels mostly sound but basic, with leesy, melony flavors. On the finish, this loses intensity and turns bready in flavor and soft in feel.",Benvenuto de la Serna 2015 Mil Piedras Viognier (Vista Flores)
"This plummy, dusty red wine is simple and straightforward in its approach to tannin and oak. Offered at a fair price it should please a wide range of palates.",Decoy 2013 Red (Sonoma County)
"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.",Trapiche 2014 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza)
"This shows some pungent, boxwood-like scents up front, followed by modest passion fruit and a bit of citrus, falling away on the finish. Drink now.",Xanadu 2015 Exmoor Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)
"Lisboa, with its cool climate, lends itself to crisp rosés like this. This lively fruity wine is touched by hints of vanilla and layers of red-fruit flavors. It is light and ready to drink.",Adega Mãe 2015 Pinta Negra Rosé (Lisboa)
"Dry earthy herbal aromas of tomato, red-berry fruits and oak set up a full palate with pounding tannins. This tastes roasted and herbal, with notes of bell pepper, tomato and creamy oak. A hard-tannin finish confirms that this Merlot skipped charm school.",Aniello 2015 006 Riverside Estate Merlot (Patagonia)
"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.",Oak Knoll 2014 Cloud Rest Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Mula Velha, “the old donkey,” is a younger wine than its name suggests. Brisk and fruity, it offers firm tannins and layers of blackberry fruit. With a touch of oak aging, the wine is developing well and will be ready to drink from late 2017.",Parras Wines 2015 Mula Velha Reserva Red (Lisboa)
"This wine is ripe, full of black fruits and soft tannins. With plenty of acidity to keep it crisp, the wine has a cool, flavorful character topped off by berry fruits. It's ready to drink.",Parras Wines 2015 Terra Grande Red (Alentejano)
"This wine is light in tannins and ripe in fruit, with a delicious red-berry character. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.",Quinta dos Avidagos 2015 Lote 138 Red (Douro)
"This is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has gentle tannins and attractive red-berry fruits. There is just a touch of dryness that gives this easygoing wine its structure. Drink from early 2017.",Château Lanscade 2015  Bordeaux
"High-toast aromas are followed on the palate by flavors that are more about wood than fruit. That gives the wine a tough, extracted character that probably will not go away.",Château Troupian 2014  Haut-Médoc
"This is a crisp and fruity wine that's perfumed and full of citrus and green fruits. It has a lively character that is filled out with the ripe fruitiness of the vintage. The aftertaste, bright and fresh, suggests it will benefit from another few months. Drink from summer 2016.",Château Vrai Caillou 2015  Entre-Deux-Mers
"Roughly equal portions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot go into this tannic blend. It may be a little too far along the aging curve, at least for showing much fruit. It's drying out—displaying a touch of leather—and should be consumed as soon as possible.",Cliff Creek 2011 Sams Valley Vineyard Claret (Southern Oregon)
"The Claret benefits from an additional year of bottle age, integrating the components (60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% each Cab Franc and Malbec). Tart red-berry fruit is accented with light toast from barrel aging. There's a slight hint of burnt rubber that will blow off with decanting.",Del Rio 2013 Claret (Rogue Valley)
"This is a light simple red, without particular varietal character. It's much like an inexpensive California Merlot—fine for every day drinking, generic and unassuming.",Delfino 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Umpqua Valley)
"This inky-colored zesty wine offers aromas of sour cherry, leather and a hint of dried herb. The extremely simple, easygoing palate shows red plum and a hint of clove alongside loose knit tannins.",Gru 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"This wine is smooth and soft, with an attractive creamy texture and light acidity. Yellow fruits and stewed pears are lifted by a mineral texture. The wine is named after the vineyard rather than after the literal Portuguese meaning of “scantily dressed.” Drink now.",J. Portugal Ramos 2015 Pouca Roupa Branco White (Alentejano)
"Light cinnamon and sugar aromas, and fresh, fruity and lightly sweet flavors make this wine easy on the palate. The texture is soft.",First & Local 2015 Chardonnay (California)
Oily aromas of citrus peel and lychee set up a lemony palate with pyrazine-influenced citrus flavors. Lychee is the lead flavor on a finish that's mildly bitter.,Amalaya 2015 Esperanza Por Un Milagro White (Salta)
"Wet stone and graphite scents up front give way to hints of honey and Earl Grey tea (bergamot). It's medium bodied and fades quickly on the finish, but it's a solid buy for under $10.",Half Mile Creek 2014 Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (South Eastern Australia)
"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture.",California Republic 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, plum and blue flower come together on this. The simple palate offers morello cherry and a hint of clove alongside soft, not very persistent tannins.",Cantina Valle Tritana 2014 Capostrano  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
This is a light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. It has spice and a layer of dry tannins that are acting as a support to the red fruits and acidity.,Château Doms 2014  Graves
This is a seriously wood-aged wine. Its burnt toast character doesn't chime with the light fruitiness of the vintage and so gives a wine that is bitter and extracted. Less overworking would have produced a better wine.,Château Pindefleurs 2013  Saint-Émilion
"This wine seems overtaken with scents and flavors of tree tar and resin. The impression of pine resin cuts out the fruit, leaving some woody flavors in the finish.",Cliff Creek 2012 Sams Valley Vineyard Merlot (Southern Oregon)
"Quady North's Flagship is what the owners consider the best lot of wine of the year. Generously slathered in toasty new oak, this very limited (two barrel) reserve from the estate's Frank's Vineyard is not the blockbuster of the previous vintage, but shows exceptional winemaking skills. Black cherry fruit is wrapped in woody tannins, a yin-yang combination that works by dissonance rather than harmony.",Quady North 2007 Flagship Syrah (Applegate Valley)
"A huge, ripe, opulent wine, rich in orange, butter, peach, honey and spice flavors. Shows great depth and power, yet finishes thoroughly dry and crisp. Should develop bottle complexities over the next six years. Blended with 15% Roussanne.",Qupé 2010 Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Not a big, overwhelming blockbuster, this harmonious blend of equal parts Grenache Blanc, Roussanne, Clairette and Bourboulenc features ripe citrus and pineapple flavors, with a hint of melon thrown in for good measure. It's pleasantly medium bodied and creamy in the mouth, with a reasonably long finish. Drink it over the next 12–18 months.",Réserve des Oliviers 2009 White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Like many of the '07 Hermitages, this isn't a huge wine, but instead shows a nice sense of proportion, marrying hickory smoke with touches of cracked peppercorns, cedar and roasted beef. Drink now–2020.",Tardieu-Laurent 2007  Hermitage
"Libatio shows nice integration with smooth tones of cassis, blueberry, white almond and dried spice. The results deliver balance and elegance and make this a food-friendly option for meat or hearty pasta dishes.",Sant Agnese dei F.lli Gigli 2006 Libatio Red (Toscana)
"Flamboyantly rich in cherries, raspberries and cranberries that are a bit tart, yet enriched with sweet oak. Firm acidity brings everything to a clean, bright finish. A pretty wine, showing elegance and finesse.",Bonaccorsi 2008 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Gavin Chanin makes this distinctive, interesting Chardonnay. Shows a ino Sherry-like yeastiness, and is minerally and streamlined. Zesty flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits round out the finish.",Chanin 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose. Medium-bodied, with tannins that are integrated and ready to soften, this Cab Franc, barrel-aged for 18 months, is really, really good, and ready to age another 3–5 years.",Cuda Ridge Wines 2008 Cabernet Franc (Livermore Valley)
"Opens with rooty, baked aromas before finding its legs and plenty of ripe, attractive berry fruit. The palate is juicy and solid, with good acidity and nice flavors of wild berry, chocolate and toast. Stylish and very solid. Definitely a food-friendly Malbec.",Doña Silvina 2006 Malbec (Mendoza)
"Bordeaux grapes mix with Zweigelt in this full-bodied, serious wine. It has initial severe tannins, followed by ripe currant and blackberry fruit. The wood aging gives good spice character. Well worth aging for 3–4 years.",Dürnberg 2007 Impetus Select Red (Niederösterreich)
"Il Veltro is a newish brand of Brunello from Montalcino that opens with bright berry nuances and background notes of spice, cola, tobacco and leather. The mouthfeel is rich and firm, enduring but not too heavy or overdone.",Il Veltro 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Fruit-driven, with pear and apple, but an interesting streak of licorice running down the spine of the wine. It has depth and good structure, so the now-dominant young fruit will have support as it ages. Worth sitting on for a couple more years.",Lange 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Complex, mineral wine, crisp but also very, very textured. Flavors of peach and red apples work with pink grapefruit to give the fruit character, while there is also a more serious complexity of green herbs. The finish is soft, still mineral. Screwcap.",Markus Huber 2010 Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"Rosemary-marinated steak, roast pork roll stuffed with prunes or dark chicken or turkey meat would make perfect paring partners to this red blend from southern Tuscany. Aromas of spice, mature cherry and leather are soft and penetrating.",Massi di Mandorlaia 2007 Colpetroso  (Maremma)
"Fragrant with a mix of sweet grass and dusty blossom, this pleasant Sauvignon Blanc makes you wonder why the grape is so rare in Oregon. Here in the Umpqua Valley it finds a sweet spot, fresh and varietal, round and tart, with the added complexity of the flowery aromatics.",Melrose 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Umpqua Valley)
"Sweet pipe tobacco and red cherry open the nose of this plush Syrah from Maremma, Tuscany. Soft, chewy tannins make this inky red wine appropriate to pair with grilled porcini mushrooms or veal in cream sauce.",Pieve Vecchia 2007 Pieve dei Monaci  (Maremma)
"As soft and smooth as velvet, with superripe flavors of chocolate, blackberry and cherry pie filling, currants, cassis and sweetly toasted oak. A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.",Piña 2007 Mimbre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.",Qupé 2009 Sawyer Lindquist Vineyard Grenache (Edna Valley)
"An unusual blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, the wine is brilliantly dry and crisp. It's rich and spicy in citrus, tropical fruit and spice flavors, brightened with bracing acidity. Opulent, yet crisp and refreshing.",Qupé 2010 Bien Nacido Cuvée White (Santa Maria Valley)
"Rich and broad in the mouth, with notes of honeyed citrus reminiscent of tangerine and a tang of peppery spice. The finish is warm, spicy and long, with a hint of vanilla oak. Drink it now and over the next year or two for its undeniable richness.",Tardieu-Laurent 2009 Vieilles Vignes White (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"Rich and opulent, showing masses of honeydew melon, orange crème, vanilla and spicy flavors. Really seductive, so easy to like. A touch of oak adds just the right note of smoke. Great with roast pork.",Tessa Marie 2009 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"With fruit picked on January 7, 2009, this superrich wine shines with acidity that picks out the fuller honey flavors. It has an almost unctuous texture, very smooth, with orange zest and peach giving a fresh side to the wine.",Türk 2008 Eiswein 375ml Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. It has got to be one of the best buys out there, so rich and smooth in berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Only 640 cases were produced, but worth a search. Drink now.",Ugly Duckling 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec.",Finca Vides 2009 Torcidas Malbec (Mendoza)
"The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension.",Petra 2003 Quercegobbe Merlot (Toscana)
"While oak can commonly overwhelm Chardonnay, this is a perfect example of an appropriate balance. Toasted notes of almond and peach pit intertwine with red apple and underripe pear; crisp acidity shines through on the finish.",Recanati 2006 Kosher Chardonnay (Galilee)
"As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas. Pretty cherry-berry and fine wood nuances are measured and understated. Firm structure and tannins, with a tart cherry note on the close.",Terralsole 2005 Solista Syrah (Toscana)
"Amarone producer Tommasi has produced this approachable blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet. The aromas are simple but direct, including cherry, spice and vanilla.",Tommasi 2005 Poggio al Tufo Rompicollo  (Maremma)
"Rounded but also fruity, this soft wine is perfumed, hinting at white flowers and tropical fruits. While the acidity is low, the fruit is easy, ripe and lightly structured.",Caves Aliança 2006 Galeria Bical (Bairrada)
"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.",Bodegas Cerrosol 2006 Doña Beatriz Sauvignon (Rueda)
"The '06 vintage was kind to the winery's basic Sauvignon Blanc, providing a clean, crisp, dry white with flavors of lemon, lime, pineapple, nectarine and honey, and a zingy touch of tart gooseberry. Shows a complexity you don't usually find at this price.",Dry Creek Vineyard 2006 Fumé Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes.",Prejean 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"The 18 months of aging in 90% American oak really shows in the forward flavors and aromas of vanilla and mocha. Some black fruit shines through on the palate in the form of cassis and black cherry. Balanced and round, though generally light weight.",Kadesh Barnea 2004 Estate Bottled Reserve Kosher Cabernet Sauvignon (Negev Hills)
"A ripe, thickly extracted Sangiovese that offers loads of blueberry fruit and cookie dough aromas. It's surprisingly thick and creamy in the mouth with toasted nut flavors on the close.",Antonino Tringali-Casanuova 2005 Patrimonio Sangiovese (Toscana)
"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features ample apple, pear and pineapple fruit that comes across as pleasant and mouthfilling, if also a bit one-dimensional. Still, it represents a reasonable value.",Tyrrell's 2006 Lost Block Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"This is a straightforward, plump, fruity Chardonnay. Round peach and lemon flavors get a burst of energy from hints of pineapple and citrus, finishing clean and fresh. Drink now.",Vasse River 2006 Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",Vega de la Reina 2006 Verdejo (Rueda)
"The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins.",Villa Vignamaggio 2003 Wine Obsession I Miti Red (Toscana)
"This Central Coast vineyard has produced an extraordinarily rich, vibrant Viognier, brimming with tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and vanilla-spice flavors. It benefits from crisp acidity, and finishes clean and off-dry.",Vinum Cellars 2006 Vista Verde Vineyard Viognier (San Benito County)
"While we'd suggest waiting for the 2007 to hit the market, this softer-styled wine is showing mature melon, tropical fruit and bee's wax aromas in front of mild citrus, lemon and pineapple flavors. It has a medium-weight body and almost a honeyed roundness. Drink now.",Analivia 2006 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Seems almost sweet, with cherry and chocolate flavors that dominate the palate. Drink now.",Battle of Bosworth 2005 Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale)
"This Sangiovese from a hot vintage definitely seems past its peak. It has a very sweet-smelling, cherry-driven nose with a touch of marmalade that is blasted by a sudden rush of oak wood.",La Gerla 2003 Birba Sangiovese Grosso (Toscana)
"A firm wine, with dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The fruit flavors are  dark fig and stewed plums; there is a bitter edge to the tannins.",Quinta do Grifo 2004 Reserva Red (Douro)
"Raspberry and cherry mingle with essence of mocha, tomato and pepper. Solid structure, full flavors and smooth tannins create a clean yet gripping texture, finishing strong and lengthy.",Recanati 2004 Kosher Reserve Shiraz (Galilee)
"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.",St. Clement 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"A soft, lightly sweet style of rosé, flavored with strawberries and a touch of caramel. Fresh, and flavorful, with balancing acidity, this is a good apéritif wine.",Quinta da Alorna 2006 Touriga Nacional (Ribatejano)
"This wine is a “product” in every sense of the word. It's consistent from year to year, and if you know Esmeralda, with its sweet blend of Moscatel and Gewürz, then you know that it delivers simple but pleasant lime, kiwi and cantaloupe flavors with a certain watery freshness.",Torres 2006 Viña Esmeralda Moscatel (Catalunya)
"With a honeyed edge of sweetness to the pineapple and lime flavors, this wine also has a zesty acidity that makes it finish with mouthwatering cleanness. It's easy to like, a nice late afternoon cocktail sipper, and good with baked ham or pot stickers.",Renwood 2006 Pinot Grigio (Lodi)
"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar. Still, it manages to push tasty apple cider, papaya and other fuller-bodied, less acidic flavors.",Tapeña 2006 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Marqués de Cáceres 2006 Blanco Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja)
"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character. The palate shows lemon, green apple and pineapple, and this lean quality is confirmed by the wine's modest 11% alcohol level. Drink now to catch it at its scouring, sorbet-like best.",Bodegas Campante 2006 Versatus White (Ribeiro)
"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.",Brick Road 2005 Nine Gums Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"The earthy spice character of this masculine but poised Pinot makes it a unique and stylish pick for red wine lovers. Flavors are balanced, the acids are in check and the finish is delicate but spicy. Overall, a nice wine with class.",Chaddsford 2005 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (Pennsylvania)
"Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish.",Ventosa 2005 Chardonnay (New York)
"For classic Rioja, Monte Real is always a good bet. This offering delivers textbook aromas of dried raspberry and cherry offset by fallen leaves and a pinch of seashell. The palate is still quite fresh, while black cherry, raisin, spice and cocoa flavors finish smooth and long, with a touch of oxidation and a Sherry note for added complexity. Drink through 2022.",Bodegas Riojanas 2006 Monte Real Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Laced with acidity, this is a complex, structured wine with great freshness as well as a dry core of botrytis. It has a rich potential, closed at the moment but holding dense texture and balance between lemon and honey. Drink from 2019.",Château de Malle 2011  Sauternes
"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022.",Presqu'ile 2012 Steiner Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"From a vineyard 1,700 feet above the small town of Corralitos comes this tasty wine that begins with aromas of smoked apple, lemon zest, honeysuckle and sea salt, as well as a struck-match element. The palate shows flavors of fresh apple, chamomile and a dusting of crushed vanilla, all set against a chalky grip.",Sante Arcangeli 2013 Split Rail Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A blend of fruit sources used for the winery's three single-vineyard wines, this bottling saw no new oak and is light golden in color with reserved notes of mineral, almond, pineapple and lees. Full bodied, rich and layered with a creamy feel, it's appealing now but should have a long life ahead.",Sixto 2012 Uncovered Chardonnay (Washington)
"This blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Carignan, Counoise, Grenache and Cinsault immediately appeals with its aromas of plum, candied raspberry and garrigue, with no oak influence anywhere in sight. It's fruit laden, focused and supple, with a feel that dazzles the senses and pure fruit flavors that just won't quit.",Syncline 2013 Subduction Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass. The vibrant palate offers layers of black cherry, dried red cherry, white pepper, truffle and savory herb alongside firm but refined tannins and bright acidity. This is all about polish and finesse. Drink 2018–2028.",Lambardi 2010  Brunello di Montalcino
"Rounded and rich, this generous, full-bodied wine comes from a single parcel in the heart of Saint-Émilion. Black fruits are structured with dense tannins and a firm tension between ripeness and dryness. The wine is powerful, finishing with pepper and spice. Drink from 2018.",Le Carré 2012  Saint-Émilion
"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",Two Vintners 2012 Some Days Are Stones Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This blend of Les Collines (60%), Lewis (20%) and Portteus (20%) vineyards, which saw 25% new French oak, offers blueberry and huckleberry along with herb and dark chocolate accents. It's supple and soft in feel, deft but with depth to the fruit flavors.",Va Piano 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This opens with an enticing fragrance of rose, violet, dark berry and underbrush. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and star anise alongside firm but fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2018–2028.",Tenuta San Giorgio 2010 Ugolforte  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Ian Brand explores fringe growing regions to deliver well-priced and fun wines for this label. This shows aromas of tight nectarine and Granny Smith apple, and the flavors are laser-focused with apple skins, yellow grapefruit pith and steely gunmetal. Its intense energy is a little wound up now, but will blossom with time.",Le P'tit Paysan 2013 Jack's Hill Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"Aromas of tilled earth, leafy forest floor, porcini mushroom, truffle and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate offers wild cherry layered with medicinal herb, black pepper and grilled sage supported by firm tannins. It's still young and a bit disjointed so give it time to come together. Drink after 2018.",Lisini 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine. Pepper, boysenberry and game consume the nose, with blackberry fruit, mint, tobacco and a greenish bitterness keeping the palate interesting.",Mesa Del Sol 2009 Syrah (Arroyo Seco)
"This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso. The smooth, almost creamy palate delivers a black cherry core while notes of graphite, clove, ground pepper and cake spice add depth. It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.",Ornellaia 2012 Le Serre Nuove  (Bolgheri)
"This is an extremely rare beast—a single-vineyard, single-varietal (Pinot Noir), single-vintage sparkling wine. Aged sur lie for 42 months, it draws you into the glass with notes of smoke, raspberry, mineral and nutty spices. The flavors are light and lively with tart, racy acidity and a long, lingering finish.",Analemma 2010 Atavus Vineyard Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",Bella 2012 Block 10 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Aromas of menthol, dried flower, ripe berry, leather and savory herb lead the nose. The rich palate delivers crushed wild cherry, stewed plum, cinnamon, anise and a hint of vanilla alongside round tannins. Despite its big, friendly structure, it also boasts finesse. Drink through 2022.",Centolani 2010 Poggiotondo  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Meaty and spicy, this wine is in an early stage of development. It has dark tannins that have an extracted, tough character. However, the weight of ripe fruit is all there, promising a rich and concentrated wine for the future. Drink from 2020.",Château Bouscaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"New-wood spice dominates the aroma of this wine, given weight by the rich black plum fruits and concentrated acidity. With its big structure and equally big fruits, this is an impressive wine for long aging. Drink from 2022.",Château Couhins 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"This wine has yeasty aromas and a light character that brings out springy acidity before the dry botrytis. It is still forming itself around the dry core, waiting to become generous and rich. Drink from 2019.",Château d'Arche 2011  Sauternes
"One of the few great values from Pauillac, this 10-acre estate has produced an attractive perfumed wine that expresses both ripe black fruit and great structure. It's not a wine for long aging with its already-fragrant acidity. It has sweet tannins, delicious fruitiness and a lengthy aftertaste. Drink from 2019.",Château Gaudin 2011  Pauillac
"As is often the case with Phélan Ségur, there is an excess of wood in this wine. Sometimes it works, as here, because the big, bold fruits are powerful enough to match the toastiness. That suggests a future as a ripe, black-fruited and structured wine with room for juicy acidity. Drink from 2019.",Château Phélan-Ségur 2012  Saint-Estèphe
"This barrel-fermented wine has opulent aromas of nougat, butterscotch and pear tart. Equally interesting flavors stress the spice and pastry notes rather than straightforward fruitiness. It is attractively rich in mouth feel, dry, full-bodied and grand in style.",Darcie Kent Vineyards 2012 De Mayo Block Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"Forward red fruits give a good beginning to this light and fruity blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. It is crisp with red currant flavors and layers of acidity. Drink now.",Univitis 2013 Château Les Vergnes  (Bordeaux)
"Briny lemon-lime aromas are simplistic. This blend of Moscatel and Merseguera is foamy, while good acidity keeps it on a level plane. Ripe, sweet flavors of lychee, honeydew and mango are pure Moscato, while acidity from the Mersequera helps this along.",Volver 2014 Tarima Sparkling (Alicante)
"This is a straightforward quaffer. Aromas of herbs, jasmine and stone fruit lead to sugary-sweet fruit flavors.",Washington Hills 2014 Late Harvest Riesling (Washington)
"From the beginning, this crianza from a very good vintage is lacking. The nose is mulchy and cheesy, with almost no fruit character. The palate is edgy in feel, while leafy, stalky red-fruit flavors are salty and taste of vanilla and caramel.",Finca La Pica 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)
Jammy fruits conflict with a firm tannic structure. This wine is not yet balanced and needs a lighter touch. Producer is Jean Paul Barre.,Château Saint-Urban 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Aromas of rhubarb, herbs and strawberry mark the nose. This feels solid and mostly fresh, while flavors of pickled rhubarb and briny plum come with sugary sweetness in front of a salty finish.",Conde de Subirats NV Brut Rose Sparkling (Cava)
"This wine is a field blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache from Bishop's vineyard. Aromas of herbs, berry, cumin and wet copper penny are followed by smooth-feeling dark berry flavors with a tart, mesquite-filled finish.",Crayelle Cellars 2013 Bishop's Block Red (Ancient Lakes)
"Lemon and spice make this a fruity while textured wine. It tastes like the chalk soil from which it comes, very mineral and flinty. This wine is all fruit now and will broaden out from 2016.",Domaine Beausejour 2014 Les Grenettes Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)
"This is just recognizably Pinot Noir, full of tannins with a tight edge. Bitter cherry flavors and very fresh acidity give a mineral flavor that is only just showing juiciness. Drink from 2016.",Les Rocailles 2014 Pinot Noir (Vin de Savoie)
"Charred, blackened aromas of mint, licorice and burnt tire overshadow the wine's black-fruit components. This feels thick and dense, with chewy weight. Medicinal, herbal flavors of black fruits are peppery and a bit green, while mint and cough drop notes control the finish of this 85% Garnacha Tintorera and 15% Monastrell blend.",Niel Santofimia 2013 Red (Almansa)
"While this wine has a strong tannic structure, it also offers plenty of ripe fruit. Acidity is kept in its place, giving freshness allied to warm berries. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",Producta Vignobles 2013 Mission St. Vincent  (Bordeaux)
"Apple and pear notes have a slightly savory tone in this brisk, lemony dry Riesling. Throughout a tasting of two samples, there are lingering tones of rubber and struck matches that blow off gradually with aeration.",Silver Thread 2014 Randolph O'Neill Vineyard Riesling (Cayuga Lake)
"This juicy red wine offers thick layers of black pepper and blueberry around sturdy oak. However, its opulent beginnings start to thin on the midpalate, veering into sour flavors and a touch of heat.",V. Sattui 2012 Malbec (Napa Valley)
"Sweet green apple, lemon and lime notes meld in this off-dry Riesling, somewhat evocative of green Jolly Rancher's candy. Whiffs of smoke and nuts add a savory dimension to this brisk, easy drinking wine. Drink now.",Ventosa 2013 Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Pickled, briny aromas of citrus and berry fruits are modest. On the palate, this is soft and low on acidity. Flavors of raspberry, cherry and red currant are mild, with a touch of bitterness.",Biutiful NV Brut Rose Garnacha (Cava)
"This crisp, fruity wine is fresh with citrus, grapefruit and an attractive zesty texture. Aromatic and bright, it is ready to drink now, clean and fragrant.",Cap Royal 2014  Bordeaux Blanc
"All Merlot, this pale-pink wine offers aromas of herbs, grass and cherry. Though the label suggests otherwise, it drinks off dry, with pit-fruit flavors.",Cave B 2014 Dry Rosé (Ancient Lakes)
"Too much extraction has given this wine a dry character. It does have juicy red fruits underneath and these should come out as the wine ages. It is likely, though, always to be a dry wine.",Château Barreyre 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This firm, smoky wine with fine tannins and ripe fruit is developing well, allowing the berry fruits to come through the structure. Give this wine until late 2016.",Château Laronde Désormes 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur
"Flat boysenberry and plum aromas are jammy and a bit floral. This feels clipped and rugged, with reedy plum and raspberry flavors that finish short.",Château Los Boldos 2013 Grand Reserve Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"From owner Jean-Pierre Palatin's vineyards at the highest elevation in this appellation, this mostly Merlot wine is soft and fruity, ripe but with little sense of structure. It is juicy and with some acidity. Light and perfumed, it is ready to drink. The winemaker is Thomas Guibert who also handles Ferrand, Palatin's Saint-Émilion grand cru.",Château Roquevieille 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"A very deep red color catches the attention. Next, strong, wild aromas like smoke and black rubber lead to a rather fruity but still firm and tannic texture. The flavors are more like blackberries and blueberries, but the overall effect is slightly viscous.",Cocobon 2013 Red (California)
"Soft, ripe and fruity, this spicy wine has attractive acidity. It offers a light texture, pepper and a bite of orange zest at the end.",Domaine de la Sanglière 2014 Juliette Rosé (Mediterranée)
"Herbal berry aromas include a heavy dose of spent coffee grinds and oak. This has an edgy, hard mouthfeel and oaky flavors of plastic and vanilla that sit on top of herbal berry notes. A creamy finish maintains the wine's oaky theme.",Doña Isadora 2012 Carmenère (Central Valley)
"Dark, dry and puckering with a stewed plum aroma and flavor, this wine offers a depth of tannin and herbal notes. A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 22% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot, it spent 20 months in French oak.",Ehret 2010 Bellarina Meritage (Knights Valley)
"Ripe and jammy with attractive soft fruits and acidity, this wine has crushed strawberry and light spice flavors. Drink from late 2016. MACIF, a mutual insurance company, bought the estate in the 1980s and restored the vineyards and beautiful château. The estate manager is Fredéric Dubois and consultant is Georges Pauli.",Château de Belcier 2013  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This wine is concentrated, with fruit that seems too ripe. Jammy berry flavors are mixed in with dry tannins and a firm backdrop. It's solid, although not quite balanced. The estate was founded in 1967 by Philippe Raguenot; daughters Emmanuelle and Marie-Pierre took over in 1997.",Château des Tourtes 2012  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"While there are firm tannins, this wine also has plenty of fresh black currant fruits. Acidity and a crisp texture give it a lift and brightness. Drink this 100% Merlot from 2016 when the tannins have softened.",Château Donjon de Bruignac 2013 Premium  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Perfumed strawberry aromas show well. On the palate, this wine is fruity, jammy in texture with good balancing acidity. The tannins still need to soften, so drink from 2017.",Château Godard 2013  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux
"Firm but with juicy fruit, this 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is a solid, still young, wine. The aftertaste is tough and packed with acidity.",Château Haut Boilon 2013  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"This Southern Rhône-style blend is roughly half Mourvèdre, 31% Grenache and 17% Cinsault. It's a delicious match-up, with the Mourvèdre underscoring the minerality, and providing grip and texture around the racy red berry flavors of the other two grapes. The wine has a spine of steel, suggesting it will age through 20206–2022.",Helix by Reininger 2011 Stone Tree SoRhô Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs. The juicy palate delivers fleshy black cherry, black raspberry, black pepper and exotic spices alongside big, velvety tannins. Soft and delicious, this is already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.",Capanna 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Jammy, ripe blueberry and blackberry aromas belie a crisp, tight palate, with wild berry, licorice and peppery flavors. This is fresh, wiry, firmly structured and alert as well as comfortable and controlled. Think classic Priorat to drink through 2018.",Cellers Unió 2009 Roureda Llicorella Gran Selecció Vitis 60 Red (Priorat)
"Hugely tannic, this formidable wine has great weight, richness and a dark and dense structure. Juicy berry fruits, sweet plum flavors and a dry, concentrated backdrop promise aging. Drink from 2018.",Château Haut Bertinerie 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"Perfumed, ripe and packed with blackberry fruits, this wine displays a great sense of elegance. It is fresh while the solid structure provides a contrast of tannins. The end shows acidity and fruitiness.",Château Lalande-Borie 2011  Saint-Julien
"A strong Merlot element has produced a ripe, juicy wine, full of fruit balanced with a subtle use of wood. It's a powerful, concentrated wine that has impressive tannins, rich berry fruits and acidity. Drink from 2018.",Château Preuillac 2011  Médoc
"This is a über aromatic wine with a long list of notes that include orange marmalade, peach, citrus, and drizzled honey. Harvested at 42 brix and retaining a whopping 240 g/L residual sugar, it's supremely rich and sweet with a lingering finish.",Koenig Vineyards 2011 Ice Wine Riesling
"The vineyard is famous for producing ripe, luscious Pinots stuffed with massive fruit. Many wineries have dipped into it over the years. Krutz's rendition is dry, balanced and full-bodied, with relatively high alcohol framing raspberry, cherry, cola, red plum, exotic spice and sandalwood flavors. It should age well through 2020–2022.",Krutz 2011 Soberanes Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"The vineyard is near if not entirely within the Arroyo Grande Valley appellation, and it shows that region's tannins, acidity and ripe, long hangtime flavors. The balanced 2012 vintage has given it tremendously ripe cherry, raspberry, red currant and cola flavors, yet the wine retains an exciting sense of control and balance. Give it until 2018–2019 in the cellar to gain traction.",Loring Wine Company 2012 Aubaine Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"It's risky to suggest aging a California Chardonnay, but you'd do well to stash this away until sometime in 2015. Right now, the wine is all about brisk acidity, oak and fresh, ripe tropical fruit, orange and pear flavors. All those parts need time to come together.",Loring Wine Company 2012 Durell Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Floral hints, latex, vanilla, oak and ripe berry aromas all show up on a fine bouquet. Ripe and creamy in feel, it holds dark, hard-pushing flavors of licorice, anise, coffee and blackberry. There's agility, elegance and complexity to this Malbec. Drink through 2017.",Los Vencejos 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"A rich barrel selection, this is a fine Pinot Noir that's silky, brisk in acidity, dry and deeply flavored in raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper cola. Give it at least until 2018 in the cellar.",Manzoni 2011 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished.",Amavi 2011 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam. The rich palate delivers dark red cherry layered with mint and a tad of milk chocolate alongside dusty tannins. It' well balanced and should age moderately well. Drink 2016–2024.",Bolsignano 2009 Grazia  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A beautiful wine to pair with desserts based on white fruits or simple but delicious vanilla sponge cake. Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.",Bouchaine 2012 Bouche d'Or Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is pure Mourvèdre from three excellent Red Mountain sites: Heart of the Hill, Ciel du Cheval and Grand Rêve vineyards. Tart, stony raspberry fruit carries a hint of cured meat and straw. The wine displays excellent length and a delicious purity.",Syncline 2011 Mourvèdre (Red Mountain)
"Andrea Cortonese makes ripe, structured Brunellos and this is an impressive effort from the variable 2008 vintage. It opens with aromas reminiscent of black plum, chocolate, vanilla and leather. These carry over to the palate along with toasted notes, spice and espresso. The fruit is supported by assertive tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2015–2023.",Uccelliera 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",Villadoria 2004 Riserva  (Barolo)
"Smooth and rich while remaining structured, this wine performs the role of second wine very well. The tannins are already rounded and the black currant fruit remains fresh. It should be ready to drink in 2016.",Château Cos d'Estournel 2011 Les Pagodes de Cos  (Saint-Estèphe)
"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol)
"The local grape Castelão is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon in this soft, spicy and fruity wine. Red fruits and balanced acidity are given a shove by a lightly tannic structure. The wine is ready to drink.",Quinta do Casal Branco 2014 Terra de Lobos Tinto Red (Tejo)
"It seems perverse to plant Gewürztraminer in the Douro and this wine is as much a curiosity as it is attractively perfumed. Showing all the hallmarks of the grape, the palate carries flavors of lychee and rosewater, although it all seems muted. The acidity does give a final lift.",Real Companhia Velha 2014 Gewurztraminer (Duriense)
"This light, fresh Chardonnay has lively pear and apple flavors. A crisp texture gives zing to the brightly fruity wine. Drink now.",Jean-Marc Burgaud 2014  Beaujolais-Villages
"This wine is light, fruity and with only a slightly tannic character. Aromatic cherry flavors give freshness and bring out a jammy character. It's ready to drink.",Jean-Marc Burgaud 2014 Les Vignes de Thulon  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Coming in a sparkly package befitting its name, this boxed wine shows honeysuckle and pineapple on the nose. On the palate, green apple flesh and pink apple skins prove tart and ripe at the same time, though without tons of body or finish. It's a solid deal though!",Jewelry Box 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Cidery aromas are briny. This feels low on bubbles but propped up by citric acidity. Orange and lettuce flavors end in pedestrian fashion, with a note of green herbs. This Cava's moderate, straightforward personality is due to the fact that it's 100% Xarello.",Juvé y Camps 2013 Essential Xarel-lo (Cava)
"Lanson suggests adding fruit to this wine or using it as the base for cocktails. It is off dry, ripe and fruity in itself. A touch of toast suggests this bottling is not young. The wine confuses between crisp acidity and a soft, neutral texture. It will probably be best when it is part of a mixed drink.",Lanson NV White Label Sec  (Champagne)
"Lots of stone fruit ripeness marks the nose of this wine, with aomas of nectarine and peach cut by the sharpness of apple skins. The palate is all green apples and lime juice.",Magnolia Court 2013 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Staunch aromas of leather and animal hide ride heavily on top of rubbery blackberry scents. This feels solid but scattered, with cherry and cassis flavors that come across jammy. Rubbery notes and a mild cheesy oak character dominate the finish.",Mamarracho 2014 The Issue of Inexpensive Wines is When They Are Not Good Enough Red (Valencia)
"Stone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.",Mantel Blanco 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Savory aromas and flavors combine with a soft texture in this full-bodied wine. It smells smoky and roasted, tastes like pomegranate and cherry juice and has a streak of acidity but not much tannin.",Red Rock 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (California)
"A blend of Arinto and Tamarez, this wine is light and fruity, with attractive acidity and flavors of apricots sprayed with lemons. It has a light texture and a fresh, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",Quinta da Lapa 2014 Selection Branco White (Tejo)
"While more herbal in character, this wine also carries grapefruit, lemon and quince flavors. It is fresh with a steely mineral character that adds some interest. Drink now.",Real Companhia Velha 2014 Quinta de Cidrô Sauvignon Blanc (Duriense)
"This blend of Merseguera and Sauvignon Blanc is modest as a church mouse, with clean but dilute green-apple aromas. An easygoing, round palate offers orange and lime flavors in front of a pithy, citrusy finish.",Castillo de Liria 2014 Winemaker's Selection White (Valencia)
"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.",San Felipe 2013 Oak Cask Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza)
"Leesy vanilla aromas are scattershot and include bready notes of baked apple and pear. This feels round, plump and low on acidity. Flavors of grassy, green citrus and tropical fruits turn bitter before flattening out on a mild finish.",Tarantas 2014 Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"This is an earthy, rustic wine tasting of black cherry, cola and a mention of sage, medium bodied on the palate and softly textured. It will please a range of palates, showing varietal character with vigor.",Decoy 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"This wine is tight, fresh with crisp red currant and red-cherry flavors. It is as bright as a button, fruity with layers of acidity that bring out a perfumed character at the end. The Colonge family has been growing grapes in Beaujolais since 1789.",Domaine André Colonge 2014  Beaujolais
"Fresh and fruity, this is a ripe, cherry-flavored wine (hence the name Griottes, a type of cherry). It is light with a straight line of acidity that cuts through the attractive fruitiness. Drink immediately.",Domaine du Vissoux 2014 Les Griottes Rosé (Beaujolais Rosé)
"Banana aromas don't intrude too strongly into the fruity palate of this wine that has a crisp character. Tart red-berry fruits and and bright acidity give the wine a fresh, totally fruity appeal with only a hint of tannin. Drink now.",Domaine Pral 2014 Les Pays de Pierres Dorées  (Beaujolais)
"Grassy, green aromas give this a herbal, crisp taste. It is tight and tangy, with green fruit aromas and a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.",Espaço Rural 2014 Alves Vieira Branco White (Alentejano)
"Salmon-colored and spritzy, this rosé of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus.",François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Pinot Gris Alta Colección Rosado (Uco Valley)
"Structured and firm, this wine has more in the way of dry tannins than of fruit. It presents a fine skeleton without much flesh, leaving a wine that is tight and extracted. It needs plenty of time, so drink from late 2016.",Georges Duboeuf 2014  Chiroubles
"This structured wine has a tight, tannic, dry character. It is slow to develop, leaving the black cherry fruits still masked by the forward dryness. Drink from 2016.",Georges Duboeuf 2014 Domaine du Paradis  (Saint-Amour)
"Forest berries, perfumed violets and pine needles entertain the nose on this widely available bottling. The palate shows dried herbs, tar and smashed blackberries.",Limited by Cambridge Cellars 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"This wine is totally fresh, with crisp red currant and riper banana flavors—a bright wine that's all fruit and refreshing acidity. The family has been in the wine business since 1811 and today works with some 50 small-production growers.",Loron et Fils 2014 Beau!  (Beaujolais)
"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",Adegas Moure 2013 Tradición Joven Red (Ribeira Sacra)
"Oaky, jammy aromas are wayward and slightly green. This blend of Tempranillo and Monastrell delivers heavy tannins on a widespread but unfocused palate. Oaky, drying berry flavors are more bitter than fruity, while the finish is choppy in feel and woody in taste.",Bocopa 2012 Alcanta Crianza Red (Alicante)
This wine offers appealing aromatics of caramel apple before delving into viscous territory on the palate. Flavors fall somewhat flat and the finish is muddled.,Cairdean Estate 2011 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The Blanc de Noir name would suggest it's a sparkling wine; it is not. The label also reads Estate White Wine. It is not. Rather, it is a rosé of Pinot Noir, lightly orange in color. Flavors recall a Pop Tart sort of pastry, simple and slightly sweet.",Cardwell Hill 2014 Blanc de Noir Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.",Viluko 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Vanilla and maple aromas lead to overtly fruity red cherry flavors with a touch of sweetness and a soft texture. It's pleasant to drink for those looking for a soft touch, with very mild acidity and no tannin to speak of.",Alias 2013 Secret Agent Red (California)
"This Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.",Bodegas Paniza 2013 Agostón Viura-Chardonnay (Cariñena)
"Smooth but tangy, this offers good fresh citrus aromas and flavors, a softer-than-usual texture but a bright, clean character that stays fresh on the finish.",Bota Box 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Chunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.",Viña Arnáiz 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Grilled peach and almond notes show on the nose, while the palate is tighter in profile, offering apple pomace and lemon rind.",Good Harbor 2011 Dry Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula)
"Light and fruity, this is an attractive off-dry wine. It has a delicate spice character along with yellow fruits that are seasoned with pepper and acidity. Drink now.",Kuehn 2013 Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This herbaceous Cabernet also contains 17% Petite Sirah but doesn't take that variety's character on as much as it does the more herbal Bordeaux grapes, namely Cab and Cab Franc. Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.",Long Meadow Ranch 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.",Mario Bazán 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.",Medlock Ames 2011 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.",Peirano 2012 The Other Red (Lodi)
"Sweet and somewhat disjointed, this 100% Sauvignon Blanc offers ripe apricot and peach before becoming slightly sour and herbal on the finish.",Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Oxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.",Zudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina)
Cinnamon and licorice gumdrop and sketchy cherry cough drop aromas make up the nose on this cloying Cab that also shows hard tannins. Baked berry and brown sugar flavors finish with little sizzle or balance.,Cascada Peak 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Tired and oxidized on the nose, this offers just-adequate freshness on the palate, but the wine is losing steam. Flavors of oxidized white fruits and bitter citrus finish dully.",Bouza de Carril 2013 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Gold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.",Eresma 2012 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda)
"Aromas of raw oak, paint and dark-berry fruits lead to a medium-bodied palate with candied, oaky, mildly bitter black cherry and plum flavors. A modest finish closes with lasting bitterness and medicinality.",Montevicor 2010 Garnacha (Calatayud)
"Grassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.",Maximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Both tart and tannic, it's unusually tight in personality, with a mouth-puckering texture, sharp fruit flavors and astringent finish. While there are too many soft and overripe Zins, this one goes pretty far the other way.",Witching Stick 2012 Fashauer Vineyard Zinfandel (Anderson Valley)
"Toasted sourdough bread and briny lemon show on the nose and palate, with dusty oak and slightly burnt toast on the finish.",Heritage 2013 Estate Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Outer Coastal Plain)
"Aromas of blueberry and cinnamon smell odd and forced. A wiry-feeling palate runs on punchy acidity, while short flavors of currant and raspberry are oaky and finish with little structure or character.",Alamos 2013 Red (Mendoza)
"This is soft and lightly flavored. Fruit and some fresh acidity are there along with spice, but the wine seems muted.",Dopff Au Moulin 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Volatile and sharp, this well-aged (though current) release tastes of vanilla, maple syrup and cut tobacco. After lengthy aging (48 months) in 60% new oak, the wood flavors have taken over.",EdenVale 2007 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
"Prune and raisin aromas announce ripeness, which comes with woodsy, earthy, murky berry scents. This feels snappy at first, then more heavy and baked. Prune and spice cake flavors are clumsy, heavy and lack cohesion on the finish.",Alto Cinco 2012 Paniza Garnacha (Cariñena)
"This is stalky, grassy and peppery smelling, with red-berry aromas. Rawness and sharp acidity keep the pulse up as basic flavors of plum and raisin take over. A modest finish keeps the course without evolving.",Black Box 2013 Malbec (Mendoza)
"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.",Hendry 2011 Hendry Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This has both a taste of vanilla-sugar on the palate and bristling acidity that demands attention, making for a wine that's slightly off-kilter. The presence of oak is restrained and the finish, in keeping with the theme, quite tart.",White Oak 2012 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This GSM blend is soft and muted. It falls flat, with dull fruit and a wash of chocolate.",Merrill Cellars 2012 Cotes du Rogue G-S-M (Oregon)
"The nose is rather closed but reveals whiffs of dark-skinned fruit. The diluted palate offers raw, red cherry alongside fleeting tannins.",Feudi del Pisciotto 2012 Giambattista Valli  (Cerasuolo di Vittoria)
"Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character.",Château Beausejour-Duffau-Lagarrosse 2009  Saint-Émilion
This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.,Château Clerc Milon 2009  Pauillac
"There is dense, ripe fruit here, although with an austere, serious edge. The wine has firm yet juicy blackberry fruits along with concentrated tannins. It is firm, dark, with the potential for good red berry fruits.",Château Magdelaine 2009  Saint-Émilion
"So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry. Explodes in blackberry and cherry pie filling flavors, with the smoky, buttery toast of oak barrels. Defines deliciousness. The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness.",Hundred Acre 2008 Few and Far Between Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a Rhône-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting.",Monteverro 2008 Tinata Red (Toscana)
"Siepi is a gorgeous 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that delivers intense aromas of ripe black fruit, rum cake, leather, moist tobacco and Indian spice. It lasts long on the palate thanks to its fine, silky texture. This vintage is slightly leaner, but brighter than the 2007.",Mazzei 2008 Castello di Fonterutoli Siepi Red (Toscana)
"Firm and muscular, with mixed berries and cherry fruit, this beautifully defined Cabernet shows excellent penetration and focus. The finish is long, smoky, and carries a hint of gun metal.",Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wahluke Slope)
"A stunning Syrah with 4% Viognier that's almost black in color and aching with deep, dark cherry and black licorice surrounded by a lush, dense herb garden. This is a heavy, rich California Syrah, practically a velvet curtain, that will appeal to Rhône aficionados and anyone with a taste for something big, accentuated by a smoky finish.",Prospect 772 2009 The Brawler Syrah-Viognier (Calaveras County)
"Quilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.",Quilceda Creek 2008 Palengat Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Poggio al Merli is a 100% Merlot that shows a perfect marriage between variety and territory. It's an opulent, soft and round wine that is woven tight with blackberry, pipe tobacco, rum cake and a touch of black olive. Velvety tannins drive a long, intense finish.",Castellare di Castellina 2009 Poggio ai Merli Merlot (Toscana)
"Pitch-black wine, very dense. It is spicy with concentrated black fruits, layered with equally intense acidity. Wood, fruit and sweet berries are all there. Tannins surround this firm wine, promising aging over 5–6 years.",Castro Pena Alba 2007 Picos de Couto Grande Escolha Red (Dão)
"With layers of wood, this is a structured wine, driven as much by tannins as fruit. It will need time for the dark plum fruit flavors to come through—St.-Estèphe is always likely to be firmly textured.",Château de Pez 2009  Saint-Estèphe
"Initially wood dominates, but this is a stage after bottling. Because then the ripe, smooth fruit comes in, pouring through with black fruits, very ripe and juicy. As this wine develops, this rich fruit will be its main character.",Château Gruaud Larose 2009  Saint-Julien
"The Doyenne Métier generally drinks very well right out of the chute, and this 2009 is no exception. Supple and concentrated, this blend of 51% Grenache, 32% Mourvèdre and 17% Syrah is an absolute riot of mixed berry fruit scents and flavors. Full, lush, dense and quite long in the finish, it's a spicy, brilliant bit of winemaking. Can it age? Undoubtedly. But good luck keeping your hands off it!",Doyenne 2009 Métier Red (Yakima Valley)
"It's sad that only 5,080 bottles of this wine were produced, as it's truly a stunner. Dark and developed, complex and concentrated, this wine exhibits such superb balance and finesse, with nuanced notes of minerality, scrubland, whole tobacco leaf, black pepper and licorice root all gracing the dark fruit core of the nose and mouth. It's lush and full on the palate, and medium tannins provide a solid structure, making the wine drinkable now or ready to age.",Gérard Bertrand 2008 L'Hospitalitas - La Clape Red (Coteaux du Languedoc)
"One of the nicest Syrahs to come from Italy, Marchesale is a rich, inky wine with intense aromas of cherry, blueberry, cola, chocolate and leather. Balanced softness and freshness characterize the finish.",Terre del Marchesato 2008 Marchesale Syrah (Toscana)
"This wonderful Brunello opens with sultry aromas of black fruit, cherry, spice, leather and tobacco. It's a rich and penetrating wine with a soft, lush mouthfeel and a hint of crisp acidity on the close. You'll want to keep this treasure in your cellar for a few more years.",Argiano 2006 L'Orciaia  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This 100% Syrah from sunny coastal Tuscany offers extreme softness and richness with chocolate, cherry liqueur, blueberry and smoked bacon fat. Pair this rich wine with game meat or stew.",Campo al Noce 2008 Syrah (Toscana)
"Based on Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, this luxe rosé bubbly is delicious to drink now. It's likeable for the array of strawberry, orange and lime flavors, with that savory sparkling wine yeastiness, and the bubbles are smooth and refined. Will set off many different foods, but sushi is a definite hit.",Chandon NV Etoile Rosé Sparkling (Sonoma-Napa)
"A wine that continues the impressive rise of du Tertre. It is becoming one of the sure values of Margaux, and this 2009 is both ripe and finely balanced. The acidity boosts the rich fruits, sweet tannins and the warm finish.",Château du Tertre 2009  Margaux
"Densely rich, very sweet wine. It has some smoky tannins that give structure, along with a dark core of dry raisin and wood flavors. It has concentration and an opaque texture.",Château La Conseillante 2009  Pomerol
"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",Chester Kidder 2007 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A delicious Syrah in the classic mold of Columbia Valley fruit. Solid and sappy, it's a mouthful of bright berry flavors, penetrating into layers of licorice, coffee and chocolate. The liquorous finish is rich and balanced, with a hint of heat.",Dunham 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.",Patz & Hall 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4–5 years.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2007 Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria Baga (Beiras)
"This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich.",Tenuta Monteti 2004 Monteti Red (Toscana)
"Big, bold and structured, this is a dry yet mouthwatering beast of a Shiraz, its blackberry, mocha and black olive notes held in check by firm tannins. Give it 3–4 years in the cellar, then drink it over the next several years.",Henry's Drive Vignerons 2008 Reserve Shiraz (Padthaway)
"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.",Volker Eisele Family Estate 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"An outstanding Hellion, 44% Primitivo, 31% Petite Sirah and 25% Zinfandel. It's a complete wine, with a full array of superbly rich berry fruits, a hint of chocolate and fine-grained tannins. Delicious right out of the bottle, but it could be cellared for at least another five years.",Angel Vine 2009 The Hellion Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",La Chablisienne 2005 Les Vénérables  (Chablis)
"A product of a hot, short growing season, Lake Folly's 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon shows some slightly overripe notes of cola and prune, but also features a high degree of richness allied to a broad, mouthfilling texture. It lacks nuance, but it is a big, flavorful mouthful that ends with hints of coffee and chocolate. Drink now–2010.",Lake Breeze 2003 Follett Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Langhorne Creek)
"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink now–2012.",Longview 2006 Devils Elbow Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Adelaide Hills)
"Aglianico and Piedirosso grapes are blended to produce a thick and broad wine with an inky black color and notes of very ripe red fruit. It has a sweet, chewy aspect with vibrant, albeit densely extracted fruit and soaring tannins. Try it with a beef stew or similarly heavy dishes.",Villa Matilde 2003 Red (Falerno del Massico)
"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",Williams Selyem 2005 Hawk Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",Craneford 2005 Allyson Parsons Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)
"Feudi di San Gregorio's distinctive take on the indigenous Greco variety favors a more saturated and concentrated style. The color  is slightly more golden and intense and the aromas reveal ripe melon, honey, dried hay and almond.",Feudi di San Gregorio 2005  Greco di Tufo
"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",Ponzi 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",Razor's Edge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"Plenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.",Torres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Penedès)
"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.",Carlos Basso 2006 Dos Fincas Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Uco Valley)
"Complex mixed stone fruits dappled with sweet cinnamon spice lead into a fairly lush midpalate. The dominant flavor is fresh cut pear, and the creamy texture spreads the flavors broadly through the mouth. A lovely wine to match with halibut or swordfish.",Daedalus 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",La Chablisienne 2005 Côte de Léchet Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.",Piattelli 2005 Premium Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"A crisp medium-bodied Cab with good varietal definition, Strathewen Hill's 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon boasts slightly minty cassis-inflected fruit, vanilla and chocolate notes and a smooth mouthfeel. Supple tannins on the finish suggest this will age well through 2012 or so.",Strathewen Hills 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yarra Valley)
"This boasts brilliant clarity, purity and aromas of orange blossom, pear, melon and peach. It's a tad flatter and creamier than other renditions of this native grape but nonetheless would make an idea match to fish, pasta salad or most chicken dishes.",Di Meo 2003 Alessandra  (Fiano di Avellino)
"Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time. Best 2008–2010.",Hendry 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",Ànima Negra 2004 Àn Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears)
"Apricot, peach cobbler, sticky honey, white flower and macadamia nut color a seductively sweet wine from Puglia, the heel of the Italian “boot.” Thanks to strong sunshine and cooling breezes, Malvasia grapes lose their water mass, resulting in rich concentration and intense fragrances.",Botromagno 2001 Gravisano Passito Malvasia Bianca (Murgia)
"A soft, medium-bodied wine that tends toward bright, red-berried fruit, this is a solid everyday Cabernet. Cedar and tobacco-leaf notes accent the cherry-berry fruit, while hints of vanilla and caramel linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now.",Nugan Family Estates 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
"A real crowd-pleaser, the 2005 Shingleback may not have quite the complexity of the 2004, but it's still a fun, approachable wine. Cola and coffee notes accent plum and blackberry flavors, while the broad texture coats the mouth with soft tannins. Drink now–2012.",Shingleback 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",Alexander Valley Vineyards 2006 Wetzel Family Estate Chardonnay (Alexander Valley)
"A nice interpretation of Grenache Blanc. Blended with a drop of Viognier, it shows notes of orange and peach jam, honey, vanilla and toasty oak. The alcohol level is high. Drink up.",Summerwood 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
"For lovers of red sparkling wine with its attendant tannins, this is a fine example. It has a definite Pinot Noir farmyard character along with tannins, a touch of smokiness, and a definite need for food.",Steininger 2010 Sekt Pinot Noir (Österreichischer Sekt)
"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.",AntoLin Cellars 2011 Estate Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"Good and dry, with tough tannins that make it hard to drink now. With blackberry, currant, molasses and dark chocolate flavors, it seems like an ager, but may not have the concentration for the long haul. Try again in 2–3 years.",Calicaro 2010 Les Fauves White Hawk Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara)
"Crusty aromas of black fruits mesh nicely with lemon peel and floral scents. The acidity here is noticeably high, which creates a scouring mouthfeel. Short flavors of berry and cassis are shrill, while the body and cushion offered by this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Viognier are modest at best.",Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Viognier Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Rubbery red-berry aromas blend with spicy field scents to create a true Pinot nose that's a bit strained. This is intense, chunky and slightly herbal, with red-fruit flavors, spice notes and some heat and oak on the finish.",Emiliana 2011 Novas Gran Reserva Made with Organically Grown Grapes Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Hay, straw, match stick and minerally aromas outweigh this wine's fruit scents by a measurable margin. This is chunky and a bit soft in the mouth, a reflection of 2012's heat. And while it's round as a ball, it's slightly vegetal and bitter tasting on the palate, with grapefruit and bell pepper flavors.",Errazuriz 2012 Max Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Aconcagua Valley)
"This solid, structured wine has black currant fruit, balanced acidity and firm tannins. The wine has a solid texture, a core of dryness and the potential to age 3–4 years.",Château Belrose 2011  Bordeaux
"Under the serious amount of wood, this wine feels rich and concentrated. Wood spice, a touch burnt, along with chocolate and black currant fruit show both extraction and the need for 2–3 years' aging.",Château de Lestiac 2011  Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux
"Solid and tannic, very firm from the opening to the finish. It is based around a dark core of wood and spice as well as more juicy fruit flavors. The wine needs time to round out and bring more of the juiciness to the fore.",Château les Mottes Pradier 2011  Côtes de Bourg
This is a rare beast from Washington—single vineyard Tempranillo aged in neutral oak coming in at less than 13% alcohol. It's soft and light with notes of red fruit and refreshing acidity that drops off on the back half.,Cor Cellars 2011 E Cor Si Move Tempranillo 24K Vineyard Tempranillo (Wahluke Slope)
"Grape and spice aromas give this wine a distinctive heady perfume. A rare style to find in the Wachau, it brings a fine balance between fruit and perfume with the textured nature of Wachau wines. Ready to drink, or age for a year. Screwcap.",Domäne Wachau 2012 Terrassen Gelber Muskateller (Wachau)
"Easy to drink this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties, with Merlot predominating. It's all about cherries, blackberries, plum jam, currants and chocolate. Not particularly subtle or ageworthy, but very pretty.",Happy Canyon Vineyard 2010 Piocho Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"This opens with a good mix of tobacco, black cherry, cola and mocha aromas. In the mouth, this offers good body, size and balance along with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of mossy black fruits. A mellow finish with a solid structure is a welcome ending.",Viña Bisquertt 2011 La Joya Gran Reserva Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"This opens with evident oak aromas of toasted wood, espresso and coffee bean followed by underpinnings of black fruit and pepper. The palate shows ripe black fruit, espresso and oak. Although it has nice depth, the finish is cut short by by drying wood tannins.",Virna Borgogno 2009 Cannubi Boschis  (Barolo)
"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",Walla Walla Vintners 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Dense planting for this vineyard has resulted in a wine that has greater concentration than in the past. The wine has firm tannins, while showing already delicious black-currant fruit. For drinking over the next 2–4 years.",Pezat 2011  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This is a pretty, well-made Barbera with an invitingly floral and fruity bouquet. The palate shows ripe black-fruit flavors accompanied by touches of spice, coffee and chocolate. This would be perfect with grilled meats.",Pico Maccario 2011 Tre Rovere  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Mondavi's done it again, produced another very nice Cabernet at an everyday price. It shows classy elegance, with blackberry, currant and mocha notes.",Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"This is a soft, appealing Chardonnay layered with toasted marshmallow and superripe peach. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusy—almost metallic—on the finish.",Robert Oatley 2011 Finisterre Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"Here's a refreshing and attractive Chenin Blanc that offers clean notes of ripe pear, green apple and honewdew melon alongside accents of cinnamon and white florals. The palate is light weight and vibrant, with lifting acidity that adds zest to the medium-length finish.",Shvo 2010 Chenin Blanc (Upper Galilee)
"Fruit and spice aromas show dark cherry, white pepper and toasted oak aromas of espresso and chocolate, with a hint of orange peel. The palate has fresh strawberry, coffee and citrusy notes but not much depth.",Stroppiana 2008 Vigna San Giacomo  (Barolo)
"Fine, rich black-fruit flavors give this wine a sense of ripeness, openness and generosity. The wood and fruit balance is already fine, showing that it will be ready to drink this year.",Château Grand Billard 2011  Bordeaux
"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.",Mitolo 2009 Reiver Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"Tea, tomato, raspberry and spice aromas are typical for Leyda Pinot. The body is a bit light and hollow, but that also means it's not heavy. Raspberry and spiced tea flavors control the palate, while plum, spice and light herb flavors work the almost dilute finish.",Anakena 2011 Ona Special Reserve Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
"With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors. The finish is gripping, however, it's pretty tart, and you have to wonder if that sharpness will ever age out. Decant and drink up.",Cade 2009 Napa Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot opens with fiery, oaky aromas that include cherry, cassis and vanilla. The palate has a severe tartaric shear to it along with clampy tannins. High-toned flavors of raspberry and plum are propped up by blazing acidity, while the finish is herbal and peppery in taste, with a scouring feel.",Caliterra 2010 Tribute Edicion Limitada Cabernet Franc-Petit Verdot Red (Colchagua Valley)
"A green, minty wave of challenging aromas comes with black olive, coconutty oak and graphite. The palate is bullish, scratchy in feel and tannic, with feral, herbal flavors of blackberry, juniper and wild herbs. Herbal and wild are the best words to describe this Syrah.",Casa Rivas 2010 Gran Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley)

"Fruity wine, light, elegant with a touch of minerality, it shows a fine balance of green fruits and its spice. The wine is all about freshness, crispness, a touch of minerality to give texture.

"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety",Hawks View 2010 Merlot (Washington)

"This is a fine, all-purpose red blend, mostly Cabernet, with time in one-third new French and American oak.

"Rich and dense, this has blackberry and black cherry jam, mocha and spice flavors. It contains 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, which lends the wine weight and body. While it's technically dry, there's a sweetness that comes from the ripeness of fruit and the caramel flavor from the oak, which gives it a sugary, bacony taste. Delicious now and for a few years.",Stephanie 2008 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Rich, exotic notes of honey-glazed papaya and warm pear are accented by touches of white flower, graham cracker and lemon custard. The palate feels round and weighty, with flavors that aren't as effusive as one might expect.

"Berry and cherry aromas are surprisingly sturdy and clean. Freshness is maintained on the palate, which is honest enough to offer modest tannic bite. Lightly spiced plum and raspberry flavors change little on an easy finish.",Felix Solis 2013 Flirty Bird Syrah (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Gritty aromas of stewed berry, lemony oak, green herbs and tin set up a tannic, chewy, highly extracted palate that's lacking in elegance. Flavors of chocolate, green herbs, blueberry, vanilla and plastic finish oaky and creamy, with lasting heat.",Marionette 2012 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)

"Initial plum and berry aromas fall off with airing and reveal notes of chemical and chewing gum dust. On the palate, this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Tannat is chewy, sticky and flat. Modest but sweet berry flavors veer toward molasses prior to finishing without much acidity or verve.",Ricominciare 2010 Malbec-Tannat (Uco Valley)

It's tart and sour on the palate, with dried raspberries and a bit more funk.",Sands Point 2012 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Dusty aromas of balloon rubber and apple juice are sketchy, but in the mouth this is fair and balanced. Flavors of lychee, mango candy and sweet papaya finish soft and lightly oxidized.",Árido 2013 Sustainably Farmed Moscato (Mendoza)
"This wine is all about perfumes and spice. It's ripe, fruity and already drinkable. Bergamot and fruity candy dominate the light acidity and soft texture.",Arthur Metz 2013 Gewurztraminer (Alsace)

"Here's a powerful Cabernet Sauvignon, ripe and opulent, offering summer blackberry, sour cherry candy, currant, dried herb and rose petal aromas and flavors. The addition of 21% Merlot brings a candied softness, but it's still pretty tannic, and wants 4–5 years in the cellar.",Sullivan 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Here's a very attractive and seductive Barolo with chiseled mineral tones that really help the wine stand out in a crowd.

"Here's a vineyard-designate Barolo Riserva with pristine aromas of cherry, wild berry, smoke, tar, licorice and leather. The streamlined mouthfeel is polished yet firm, and the wine offers a long fade of cherry and spice flavors.",Cavallotto 2004 Bricco Boschis Riserva Vigna San Giuseppe  (Barolo)
"The prized Cannubi cru offers fruit that is interpreted by some of the finest winemakers in northern Italy. This expression from the dynamic Damilano winery is characterized by tight tannins, power, personality and ripe berry flavors. Pair this Barolo with risotto topped with thinly shaved truffles.",Damilano 2006 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Very different than the 2005 vintage, Barolo Le Coste from Giacomo Grimaldi opens with a brownish-amber color and ripe berry or candied fruit aromas. There are beautifully fine aromas of tar, asphalt and licorice in the background that help balance it out. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",Giacomo Grimaldi 2006 Le Coste  (Barolo)
"This brilliant Sauvignon Blanc should be scooped up by sommeliers. It's exceptionally dry and tart in citrusy acids, with a mineral scour that's perfect for shellfish or savory appetizers. The flavors are of lemons, limes, gooseberries and white pepper. Beautiful and compelling.",Broman 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"From 100% grand cru Chardonnay vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich but almost bone-dry wine. It has a great mineral character that offers freshness, apple skins and a flinty edge. The disgorgement date is indicated on the bottle. Impressive, this would benefit from six months' aging.",De Sousa & Fils NV Réserve Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"From a cool part of the valley, this wine is marked by fresh acids that give it a grapey jamminess. It's very rich in black cherries, black raspberries and toast, and very dry. Feels sharp and angular now. Give it through 2010 to calm down.",Dutton-Goldfield 2007 Dutton Ranch-Freestone Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A beautiful Gewürz that could get more people to drink this Alsatian variety. It's dry and crisp, with rich flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, honeysuckle flowers, lychee nuts, vanilla and Asian spices.",Dutton-Goldfield 2008 Dutton Ranch-Green Valley Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Green Valley)
"You want black pepper? You'll get plenty of it in this dry, interesting Rhône blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. It has briary flavors of wild blackberries, with an edge of leather, tobacco and herbs, and is thoroughly dry. Pretty tannic, too. An interesting wine, and one to watch.",Twisted Oak 2007 River of Skulls Dalton Vineyard Red (Calaveras County)
"A very fine Cabernet, dry and firm, but it needs a little time in the cellar. Astringent now, it has a deep core of black currants and cedar, with the polished tannins that Napa so easily crafts. Try between 2010–2012.",Waypoint 2006 Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth. Aging for 18 months in new French oak brings in coffee and chocolate, balanced and subtly displayed. Nice details of leaf and leather run richly into the tannins.",Whitman Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A good Cab, dry and balanced, whose tannins are richly impressive and sweet. Shows a good tension between the oak and the ripe black currants. Easy to like, and should develop for a few years.",Wild Oak by St. Francis 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Elegantly structured, with firm tannins, a silky texture and a fine balance of fruit, acidity and oak. Shows cherry, red currant, cola and sandalwood flavors that are delicious, but those tannins close in on the finish, making the wine hard. Try after 2011.",Alma Rosa 2007 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A 50/50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows big fruity flavors tempered with a dry core of tannins. There is a stalky element of black currant skins which adds to the sensation of dryness, but there is also a more mouthfilling character of black plum juice to give the wine a final roundness.",Vieux Château Gaubert 2005  Graves
"This is a thickly extracted Amarone with fruit-driven aromas of strawberry, cherry and blackberry preserves. It is inky and dark in color with impenetrable density and a smooth quality to its tannins. Allegrini is one of the most historic and well-respected producers in Valpolicella.",Allegrini 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Tangy berry/black cherry fruit is backed with lots of acid and hints of earthy funk. It's not vegetal but it is definitely herbal, a complex and flavorful reserve that falls right between Balboa's regular Syrah and the Sayulita.",Balboa 2007 Reserve Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lamorèmio is a blend of Nerello Mascalese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola in equal parts that tastes of Indian spice, clove, sweet cinnamon and blackberry. You'll also get a touch of caper or green olive that rides on the heels of the wine's smooth, supple mouthfeel.",Benanti 2005 Lamorèmio Red (Sicilia)
"Il Monovitigno is a pure expression of Nerello Mascalese—Mt. Etna's most promising variety—with aromas of black olive, Indian spice, mesquite, black fruit and volcanic ash. It's tonic and fresh in the mouth and encourages a pairing with spicy meat recipes.",Benanti 2006 Il Monovitigno Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia)

"We won't call this the best Terrunyo SB to date, but it is typically clean, mineral and full of lime and passion fruit. The overall balance and purity are up the ladder, while the flavors of green fruits, passion fruit, brine and lime don't hold back. Top notch SB from Chile to drink now.",Concha y Toro 2008 Terrunyo El Triángulo Vineyard Block: 28 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Following the elegant Deutz tradition, this wine has a character that is light as a feather, but still anchored into vivid red fruits and tight acidity, leavened by a softness. The final taste is soft, but well integrated.",Deutz 2005 Rosé Brut  (Champagne)
"Ripe and oaky. May fall a bit short on complexity and finesse, but makes up for it in sheer power. Pineapple crème brûlée, spicy green apple butter, ripe pear, Asian spices and smoky oak are the flavors, backed with firm acidity.",J Vineyards & Winery 2007 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Young and fresh in citrusy acidity, with forward fruit flavors of cherries, raspberries, pomegranates, cola, bacon and sweet oak. Good and dry and silky, but immature.",James Family Cellars 2007 Stony Point Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is an example of a lighter, drier style of Cabernet that maintains great elegance and charm. It's very dry, showing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and brightened with crispness. Best now–2011.",Long Meadow Ranch 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.",Marchiori & Barraud 2007 Cuartel 2 Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Perdriel)
"It's been a while since we've reviewed this wine, so this is a fine comeback. Plum, blackberry and rubber aromas are solid, but the real star is the palate, which is smooth and thick, with lush dark fruit flavors and a smoky background. Good, slightly herbal and long on the finish.",Morandé 2007 Edición Limitada Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"It's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it. The wine shows classically fine tannins, while the flavors run toward milk chocolate, ripe blackberries and lots of crushed black pepper. Delicious and refined, a great wine for peppersteak.",Newsome-Harlow 2007 El Portal Petite Sirah (Calaveras County)
"Great now with lamb, this Pinot is softly complex and forward in fruit, with a silky texture. It shows cherry, raspberry, mocha, anise and smoky oak flavors. Best now and for a few more years.",Pali 2007 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is Peju's best Sauvignon Blanc in many years. It's bone dry and elegantly crisp in acidity, a clean, vibrant, food-friendly wine. With just a hint of oak, it shows rich flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, with exotic notes of papaya and white flowers. What a great comeback.",Peju 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Could almost be Zinfandel, it's so spicy and briary, with wild berry, red currant and tobacco flavors. But it's lighter in body, with the silky texture of Pinot Noir, and drier than any Zin could be. A lovely, complex and food-friendly wine.",Quivira 2007 Wine Creek Ranch Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)
"If you want to taste ripe Pinot Noir in Champagne, this grand cru blend (with 40% Chardonnay, 60% Pinot Noir) from Soutiran is where to come. The wine has weight, delicious white fruits and kiwi, and a textured mouthfeel. It is concentrated, certainly in a food wine style.",Soutiran NV Brut Grand Cru  (Champagne)
"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.",SuLei 2007 Beet Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Named after local nobility in the city of Borba, this is a popular brand in Portugal. In its white manifestation, the wine is soft, very clean, with pear and cinnamon flavors, the texture just moving toward fat, but working well as a food wine.",J. Portugal Ramos 2006 Marquês de Borba White (Alentejo)

"Creamy and full in the glass with thick streaks of glycerin, this is a luminous white blend with pretty aromas of stone fruit, honey and peach cobbler. The wine has a smooth, full consistency and a soft, generous finish.",Rocca Bernarda 2006 Vineis White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Dark, soft and rich, this single-vineyard Pinot brims with deep, almost brooding flavors of red currants, cherries, red plums, mocha and dusty spices. It also has an edge of tannins that will help it negotiate a good steak. Drink over the next several years.",Stephen's 2005 Encell Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"Former Wild Horse proprietor Ken Volk is back with his own personal brand after selling the winery. He's sourced his fruit from this very famous old vineyard. It's a good start, a deep golden wine showing ripe apricot, pear and sweet smoky oak flavors.",Kenneth Volk 2005 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"A very easy wine to like. It's so softly balanced, so rich in cherries, licorice and smoky vanilla, so light in texture, you could drink it as a cocktail wine. But it will also nicely complement a wide variety of foods.",Lava Cap 2004 Reserve Cabernet Franc (El Dorado)
"This Manzoni (a cross between Riesling and Pinot Bianco) opens with a pretty, luminous glow and offers pristine aromas of stone fruit, mango and vanilla. Natural structure and smoothness underscore the variety's pairing potential with most Thai or Indian dishes.",Masottina 2006 Incrocio Manzoni 6.0.13 Manzoni (Colli Trevigiani)
"Although Pinot Grigios are white wines, you could consider this a rosé instead because of its luminous copper color. The wine boasts a thick, creamy consistency and has a generous, plush feel in the mouth. It's a special and carefully crafted wine.",Comelli 2006 Amplius Pinot Grigio (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"Ripe, smooth, just veering toward rustic, but also showing a fine balance of tannins and sweet fruit. It is certainly rich, while the spicy character, with the dried fruits, is generous. The acidity is understated.",Cortes de Cima 2005 Aragonez Aragonês (Alentejano)
"A little sweet, dense and pasty on the nose, and that's also how the wine plays out. It's a ripe style of Carmenère, with brooding but not overly expressive black-fruit flavors. Ripeness is clearly not an issue as it shows no vegetal or herbal notes. Simply big, bold and not terribly unique.",De Martino 2006 Legado Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"This is a fuller and creamier rendition of Pinot Grigio with pretty aromas of honey, peach blossom and melon that give the wine a fragrant aromatic lift. It leaves a lean but smooth impression in the mouth and ends with bright citrus flavors. Imported by MW Imports.",Eugenio Collavini 2007 Villa Canlungo Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"You don't think of Livermore Valley as Pinot territory, but this is a pretty nice wine. It's medium-bodied and silky, with pleasurable flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, vanilla and smoke, and a long, sweetly spicy finish.",Fenestra 2005 Pinot Noir (Livermore Valley)
"This delicious Chardonnay offers creamy opulence and rich notes of vanilla, honey and peach. It has dense, slightly sweet, fruit flavors lavished over good structure and ends with spicy crispness. Pair it with white meat or pasta salad.",Folonari 2007 Chardonnay Chardonnay (Delle Venezie)
"This Cab/Merlot/Syrah blend is very much in a Washington style, with crisp acids and tart berry and currant flavors, wrapped in chocolate and showing a few specks of pepper, presumably from the Syrah. It's solid and well-made and a good example of how Oregon vintners are breaking out of the Pinot box.",Brimstone 2006 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (OR))
"Here is a full-force Pinot Bianco with compelling notes of mature apricot, candied fruit, honey, pine nut and maple syrup. The wine has a saturated, golden hue and resin-like flavors that add texture and dimension.",Castello di Porcìa 2006 Pinot Bianco Pinot Bianco (Friuli Grave)
"A blend of 70% Clairette, 15% Sémillon and 15% Rolle, this is a slightly nutty, almondy white with touches of honeyed richness and apricot. Turns a bit astringent on the finish.",Château Calissanne 2006 Clos Victoire White (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Here's an interesting rosé fans of obscure winegrapes will love. It's 90% Tibouren, an old variety indigenous to Provence that's known for its finesse but also for its difficulty in the vineyard. This wine also stays an entire year in tank resting on its lees, so it's not a fruit-forward rosé at all. Hints of apricot and peach are subtle, with the emphasis being on the wines crisp acids and dry finish.",Château du Galoupet 2005 Tibur Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Ripe and juicy, this is packed with black currant fruit and lined with soft, open tannins. The wine has a dry core, yet this is surrounded by attractive smoky fruit and bright acidity. Ready to drink now.",Château Beauvillage 2009  Médoc
This is a very rich wine with black fruit and bitter coffee flavors and dense tannins. Its weight is almost too much for the firm structure that is underneath.,Château Cap Léon Veyrin 2009  Listrac-Médoc
"Big fruit aromas of plum, raspberry and a whiff of pepper start this enjoyable red from Gerovassiliou. On the palate, flavors of spicy black fruit, clove and smoke appeal and should pair well with grilled meat dishes and stews.",Gerovassiliou 2007 Evangelo Red (Epanomi)

"A blend of approximately 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petit Verdot making up the remainder, this barbecue-ready wine is scented with dried herb and forest floor components. Brambly berry fruit and tart acids work to balance out the earthy tannins.",Alexandria Nicole 2009 Quarry Butte Destiny Ridge Vineyards Estate Grown Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Andis's 100% Barbera tempts with ripe, dried black-cherry and mint flavors, and toasty layers of coffee and toffee that linger until the finish.",Andis 2010 Barbera (Amador County)
There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character. Tart acidity and a concentrated red-cherry flavor are accented with graphite and black tea notes.,Anthony Nappa 2010 Bordo Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Packed with superripe Merlot, this is rich and round. It has wood flavors and sweet, juicy black-plum fruits that are balanced by firm tannins. The finish shows some bitterness from over-extraction.",Château au Pont de Guitres 2009  Lalande de Pomerol
"Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink.",Château Bellegrave du Poujeau 2006  Haut-Médoc
"This is structured and firm, with its dry tannins prominent along with blackberry and black cherry acidity. The wine does have density, a dusty texture and the chance to further age.",Château Haut-Goujon 2008 La Rose Saint-Vincent  (Lalande de Pomerol)
"This shows the rich density of Merlot in 2009, giving a solid structure, with dried fruit and red berry flavors and a concentrated line of tannins. Big and dense, this is ready to age.",Château La Fleur Plaisance 2009  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"A very rich wine—this has a warm, soft mouthfeel and ripe, jammy flavors enhanced with oak. Except for the heat, it's a lovely wine. Drink now.",Justin 2008 Isoceles Reserve Red (Paso Robles)
"Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find. It's rich in orange, apricot and buttered toast flavors, with balancing acidity and a dry finish.",Leese-Fitch 2010 Chardonnay (California)
"With a rich, velvety texture and flavors of black cherries, green olives and smoky cedar, this is a very nice Merlot for drinking now. Drink this with upscale fare.",Martin Ray 2010 Reserve Merlot (Oak Knoll District)
"This is 75% Merlot, with Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah comprising the other 25%. Despite all of the components, it tastes like there is a bit of a hole. The fruit is soft and plummy, and the overall balance is excellent.",Obelisco Estate 2009 Reserve Merlot (Red Mountain)
"This opens has a bold appearance with dark extraction. The aromas that follow are reminiscent of ripe cherry, cinnamon spice, plum and pulpy black fruit. Round and soft, this closes with firm grittiness.",Ponchione Maurizio 2009 Monfrini  (Roero)
"One of the small Sauvignon Blanc areas close to Sancerre, Menetou-Salon produces a light, crisp and herbal style of wine. This fits that bill well, its freshness contained within the flavors of hedgerow fruits and tangy acids.",Fournier Père et Fils 2010 Côtes de Morogues  (Menetou-Salon)
"Everything in this wine is strong and obvious: With its powerful tropical fruit, sweet oak and intense finish, this is what many Americans like in Chardonnay. But as impressive as the winemaker's art is here, the flash is all on the surface. Drink up.",Freeman 2010 Ryo-Fu Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Smooth and rich, this has superripe Merlot. It has soft, jammy red-fruit flavors and tannins that are enveloped by the opulent texture. The tannins should allow the wine to age over 3–6 years.",Horeau-Beylot 2010 Château la Fleur Poitou  (Lussac Saint-Émilion)
"Blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors give this an appropriate air of sophistication. It should pair with pizza or pasta.",Bersano 2009 Costalunga  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Here's a rustic zesty red that has aromas of ripe berry, game and whiff of tilled soil. The gamy note carries over to the simple, quaffable palate along with ripe black cherry and a hint of dark spice. Drink soon.",Carletto 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"Clover and apple aromas are basic but fresh. This is simple on the palate, with little to the mouthfeel. Vapid flavors of soda crackers, spent yeast and apple cider disappear on a quick finish.",Codorníu NV Reserva Cuvée Barcelona 1872 Sparkling (Cava)
"This superripe, late-harvest style of wine smells like raisins and dried plums. It tastes so fruity and ripe that it's sweet, with a full body to match. It would be best as a dessert wine.",2Plank 2014 Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Brassy in color and woody in aroma, this Chardonnay is a pleasant enough drink, offering ample weight and modest pear and citrus flavors. Drink it through 2017.",Angove 2014 Family Crest Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)
"Rubbery raspberry and plum aromas are decent. This feels crisp and abrasive on the surface, but sort of empty in the middle. Lean snappy plum and raspberry flavors end with scratchy tannins and a medicinal aftertaste.",Bodegas Riojanas 2015 Canchales Vino Joven  (Rioja)
"Purple flower and mature dark berry aromas lift out of the glass. Extremely simple and diluted, the palate offers suggestions of morello cherry, a hint of spice and loose-knit fleeting tannins.",La Fiera 2015  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"Candied berry aromas lack crispness. This feels hard, with little give and depth to the palate. Burnt toasted berry flavors are hot and fall off on a clumsy finish.",Gorrebusto 2015  Rioja
"Grassy stalky berry aromas lean towards green. This feels grippy, while spicy herbal berry flavors stay the course and finish with minty green notes on top of basic plum and berry.",Trapiche 2014 Oak Cask Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"The wine is lean for the vintage, tight and with an austere structure. Its tannins and juicy red fruits are in the background. The aftertaste is dry and firm.",Château Kalon Nodoz 2012 Carpe Diem  (Côtes de Bourg)
"Too alcoholic for its own good, the wine is full bodied and heavy. It has tannins, superripe black fruits while missing structure and acidity. It is developing fast and will be ready to drink from 2017.",L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Light aromas of red fruit, game and vanilla are followed by quite tart puckering fruit flavors. It needs food to counteract the screaming acid.",Oak Knoll 2011 Goose Ridge Vineyard Barbera (Columbia Valley (WA))

"This shows the tannic chewy, vegetal nature of the grape, without off-setting it with other flavors. One-third new French oak has made little impact, and the wine is rough and astringent through a quick finish.",South Stage 2012 Carmenère (Rogue Valley)
"This easygoing, informal wine offers subdued aromas suggesting cassis, raisin and a note of dried herb. The simple palate shows mature plum and a hint of clove alongside fleeting tannins.",Umani Ronchi 2015 Podere  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)

"Most of the action is on the outside of this gaudy bottle. However, this light and slightly sweet wine has appley, floral flavors and a soft, easy texture.",La Catrina NV Pinot Grigio (California)
"Heavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic.",Venta Morales 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This light-colored and light-bodied wine combines an earthy, metallic aroma with mildly fruity, candied flavors. Its texture is mild and smooth.",Grayson 2015 Lot 6 Merlot (California)
"Prickly berry aromas include notes of both candied raspberry and cinnamon. This feels a bit clunky and sticky, with sugary berry flavors and a slightly cloying finish.",Bodegas Isidro Milagro 2015 SPÑ Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Dusty aromas of desert brush, oak, blueberry, animal hide and green herbs are strained. This feels raw and choppy, while reedy herbal red-fruit flavors finish with a note of raisin. This Monastrell (with 10% Syrah) is okay but all over the map.",Campos de Risca 2013 Estate Wine Organic Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)

"Slightly sweet and quite light in body, this wine has modest peach and herb aromas, generic fruit flavors and a soft texture.",Bota Box 2015 Riesling (California)
"Lemon and apple aromas precede a high-acid citric palate without much elegance or finesse. This pedestrian Albariño deals pithy orange flavors that come with a note of grape skins. On the finish, this seems like orange juice.",Lo Nuevo 2015 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"High-toned aromatics complement aggressive, unintegrated flavors of raw wood. It's lumber, not toast, that you taste, along with bitter tannins and little evidence of ripe fruit.",Wetzel Estate 2012 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Crushed stones and river rocks take center stage in this elegant off-dry Riesling.

"A touch of smoky petrol in the aroma and flavor adds intrigue to this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine. A lot of effort in the winery, including native fermentation, 33% new French barrels and lees stirring helped it have a good sense of depth and richness without being overripe, contributing a mouthflling sensation and lingering finish.",La Folia Winery 2015 Vermentino (Sierra Foothills)
"The restrained nose just gives a glimpse of lemon freshness. Lemon notes intensify on the palate, where they attain a lovely textural feel of pith and zest. A slender wine, it still carries a hint of yeast on the midpalate, but is subtle, clean, slender and fine. The finish is dry and refreshing.",Malat 2016 Ried am Zaum Hefeabzug Pinot Blanc (Wachau)
"Tight and focused, this opens with aromas of wild berry, red rose, culinary spice and a whisper of menthol. Chiseled and austere, the palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a hint of anise. Youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2023–2033.",Marchesi di Barolo 2013 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"This 100% varietal wine brings lightly styled aromas of green grass, herb, snap pea and whiffs of green pepper. The palate is full bodied and textured, bringing a sense of richness but never losing its balance. It lingers on the finish.",Matthews 2016 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))

What's really nice is the freshness and overall supple texture.",Máté 2007  Brunello di Montalcino

Production was 2,370 cases.",Merry Edwards 2009 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

Crushed black pepper and cardamom also make a brief, but lively, appearance.",Quattroventi 2006 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)

You can drink it now, but give it an hour or two of decanting.",Chronicle 2009 Cerise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"While the texture of this Pinot is silky and light, it's dramatic in flavor. The cherries, plums, pomegranates and persimmons are packed together into a dense core of taste, all spiced up with cinnamon, cloves and anise.

"A terrific Pinot Noir, from a winery compiling a serious track record. Grown on the Napa side of Carneros, the wine shows classic Primo's Hill character, with the blackberry pie, cola, mushu plum and sandalwood flavors accented by a little more acidity than usual. Defined by elegance and complexity, it's an ager, although it's beautiful now right out of the bottle. Should easily develop through 2015.",Kazmer & Blaise 2009 Primo's Hill Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This is a big, mouthfilling Cabernet, rich and voluptuous in fruit.

Delicious now and through 2014.",Kirkland Signature 2007 Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex.

"Rich, savory and appealing now for its smooth texture and forward flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries and oak. A lovely wine for grilled steaks and chops.",X 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Not a wine for the faint of heart. Alluring notes of raspberry, blackberry, smoke and coconut set the scene for powerful flavors of strawberry and black pepper in the mouth. Tannins are abundant but polished. The finish is a bit of a disappointment, with a whisper of astringency and a huge hit of coconut. Still, well done and fairly priced. Drink with steak.",Ballast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)

"86-88 Barrel sample. Firm, with a bitter, tight edge, this has high acidity, spice, and a tight layer of tannins. For a second wine, this is not that accessible.",La Chapelle de Potensac 2008 Barrel sample  (Médoc)
"One of Italy's most interesting and least-know wines, Sforzato di Valetellina is made with dried Nebbiolo grapes in much the same way Amarone is made. In fact, sforzato means “forced” in Italian and alludes to the extra concentration given to the wine.

Rich and savory, this Cab delivers lots to like.",Seventy Five Wine Co. 2006 Amber Knolls Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
"Here's a lusty, rugged Zinfandel marked by strong, superripe flavors. The blackberries and plums veer into currants and raisins, and finish spicy and dry, while enormously high alcohol gives the impression of heat. But that's Zinfandel for you.

"Aged mostly in stainless steel with a touch of new French oak (10%), this has notes of toast and char along with freshly cut mango. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied, drinking just a hair off dry with a bitter note on the finish.",Girardet 2011 Chardonnay (Umpqua Valley)
"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",Lusco 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"After opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.",Damalisco 2008 Crianza  (Toro)
"This is a rustic but likeable wine. It's dry, tannic and full-bodied, with good varietal flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and sweet, smoky oak. Drink soon.",Hill Wine Company 2010 Black Dog Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From a very hot and difficult vintage, this Chianti Classico has unusual aromas of dill, thyme and toasted oak that carry over to the palate. It's already evolved with a short finish.",Vignavecchia 2011  Chianti Classico
"The Cabernet Moravia grape is a cross between Cabernet Franc and Zweigelt. Here, it incorporates all of Cab Franc's leafy herbaceousness and Zweigelt's tart, cranberry flavors in a refreshing wine. It's delicate in concentration, but easy drinking, with lots of green, grassy notes on the finish.",Vino z Czech NV Cabernet Moravia (Moravia)
"This meaty, oaky Sauvignon Blanc, with a trace of Semillon, is slightly bitter with grassy and lemony aromas and flavors coming to the fore.",Martin Ranch 2011 J.D. Hurley Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Clara Valley)
"A common, country-style wine, rich in cherries, cola and spices, with lusty tannins. It's lush and simple, but will rise to the occasion with a cheeseburger. The blend is Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Graciano.",Cameron Hughes 2010 Lot 362 Red (California)
"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.",Casarena 2011 Estate Bottled Malbec (Mendoza)
"Earthy with hints of roasted nuts and dried herb, this is a uniquely savory Sauvignon that would pair well with herb-accented fowl and fish. The palate is round and rich, but balanced with brisk lime acidity and a characteristic grassiness on the finish.",Ciringa 2011 Fosilni Breg Sauvignon Blanc (Slovenia)
"This deeply saturated wine opens with a nice balance of ripe, chewy fruit, vanilla and spice. The wine promises to evolve over time, giving more space to the mineral nuances you can already detect now. Tones of licorice, black spice and clove are lively and intense in the mouth.",La Calonica 2006  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"An atypically light, delicate style of Riesling for the Pfalz, with lime and floral notes on the nose and a filigreed interplay of residual sugar and lithe acidity that lingers on the finish.",Lingenfelder 2007 Freinsheimer Musikantenbuckel Kabinett Riesling (Pfalz)
"Pian delle Vigne's 2004 Brunello is worlds apart from the scorching hot 2003 vintage—so different, in fact, the wine seems utterly reborn. You can smell those hallmark Sangiovese aromas: cherry, blue flower and wet earth, and taste the variety's elegant acidity.",Marchesi Antinori 2004 Pian delle Vigne  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Bold and modern, Fonterutoli delivers the goods year after year. The wine is rich and plush with deep concentration and excellent intensity. You'll get aromas of bright cherry and some spice but what makes the wine stand apart is the clarity and purity of its aromas.",Mazzei 2007 Fonterutoli  (Chianti Classico)
"Very ripe and extracted, just oozing the flavors of melted blackberry jam, black raspberry purée and milk chocolate. A bit sweet, but saved by firm tannins.",Novy 2006 Parsons' Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"The fruit scents explode from the glass, showing raspberries, blueberries, cherries and plums in profusion. There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.",Edmonds Winery 2007 Solstice Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Verging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality. Finishes long, with a hint of bitterness that helps balance some of the intense sweetness.",Fitz-Ritter 2006 Beerenauslese Rieslaner (Pfalz)
"Aromas of peach, lime and mineral make a first-rate initial impression, and are then followed by zesty citrus flavors that enhance rather than overpower the briny minerality. It's 13% alcohol, but maintains a wonderful balance of alcohol, acid and just a hint of sugar. Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Musenhang Spätlese Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"Compared to Highlands' regular Cab, this is a great example of sometimes, more is less. The '06 Reserve is a gigantic wine, both in ripely extracted currants and in the taste of new, smoky oak. But it's very size makes it ponderous. The question is one of ageability. It could well be a sleeper. Try beyond 2010.",Highlands 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"The nose has a ripe plum and savory spice character in this sophisticated red. On the palate, cedar, mocha and pepper give it a rich, brooding quality. Tannins are fine but ageable. The finish is lingering and spicy. Pair now with richer meat dishes; give it a few years to age and it will be even better.",Vergelegen 2005 Mill Race Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Stellenbosch)
"This big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State. There is a generous streak of vanilla cream, a soft and very buttery mouthfeel, yet the fruit has enough precision and focus that the wine does not lose definition. Delicious now, this is a wine to drink over the next three or four years.",Arbor Crest 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins. But it's so rich in black currants, black cherries, chocolate, pepper and sweet, smoky oak that it's delicious now.",Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 113 Syrah (Mount Veeder)
"Liquid smoke, brimstone, tar, asphalt, licorice and mesquite follow dense aromas of black cherry, dried currants and mature plums. The wine is on the ripe, chewy side but ultimately finds balance thanks to its naturally firm tannins and fruity freshness.",Camigliano 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"Ripe, elegant wine, balancing fresh currant and red plum fruits against a mineral, dry structure. The acidity, the pure fruits and the solid tannins all work harmoniously together.",Château Dutruch Grand Poujeaux 2005  Moulis-en-Médoc
"This is a vibrant and fresh Brunello that offers a thick layer of plush fruit backed by shadings of spice, leather and cola. The mouthfeel is succulent and chewy and the tannins give the wine dimension and backbone. Drink now through 2015.",Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"Here's a strongly flavored Merlot, made with ultraripe fruit. If it didn't have a good structure, the blackberry, currant, mocha and anise flavors alone would make it a fruit bomb. Fortunately, fine acidity and gorgeously thick tannins give it structure and backbone. Best for a year or two.",Crane Brothers 2005 Crane Ranch Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"One sniff announces a wood pile's worth of toasty, dusty oak. But there's all the bold Tempranillo fruit and classic RDD terroir here to absorb it. Ripe as can be on the palate, with equal parts mulled black fruit, spice and mocha. It finishes smooth, with generous extract but nothing grating or grabby. Drink now through 2012.",García Figuero 2004 Tinto Figuero 15 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"This broad, mouthfilling dry Riesling features powerful flavors of baked apple and dried spices, uplifted and amplified by oily, minerally accents. It's just a touch off-dry, balanced on the finish by crisp acids and pronounced minerality.",Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2007 Forster Jesuitengarten Grosses Gewachs Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"The relatively low residual sugar in this wine gives it a leaner feel than Mosbacher's other 2007s, but the fruit comes through as lime, grapefruit and passion fruit, marked by Forst's prominent minerality. Very crisp and long; would pair well with many seafood dishes.",Georg Mosbacher 2007 Forster Elster Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"From a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5–6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.",Picardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton)
"This is a great Chianti Classico Riserva that offers everything you look for in a wine from Tuscany. There's freshness and pristine cherry aromas along with spice, black mineral and fresh acidity on the close.

"One thing we've discovered about Tenuta La Fuga is that it performs evenly, year after year, despite climatic variations and extremes. That's a telltale sign of good winemaking and this Brunello delivers a sure bet to consumers thanks to its soft, supple mouthfeel and lingering aromas of succulent cherry and spice.",Tenuta La Fuga 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"Enzo Tiezzi has perfected his classic, traditional Brunello and delivers a tonic and fresh wine that would pair magically with hearty meat or pasta dishes that need to be broken down with extra acidity. On the nose, it shows aromas of sweet spice, almond, vanilla, caramel and wild berries.",Tiezzi 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"Ripe, fruity and delicious. Flatters with deep, long flavors of blackberries, black currants, cassis and cedar, with a lush, tannic mouthfeel and long finish. Nice now, and should develop beyond 2012.",Trinchero 2005 Chicken Ranch Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This modern vineyard-designate Riserva offers toasted notes of spice, nut and crème caramel. There are fruit notes in there too that are surrounded by mineral and earthy shadings. The mouthfeel is gritty, firm and persistent.",Borgo Scopeto 2005 Vigna Misciano Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Franco Pacenti makes excellent use of wood, resulting in a Brunello that shows fine balance between fruit and spice. The wine exhibits a slightly brownish hue but brings bright freshness and acidity to the table. Pair it with pasta or cheese risotto.",Canalicchio Franco Pacenti 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"Made 50/50 from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvigon, this dry, orange-pink-colored wine has an appreciable amount of tannin as well as plenty of fruit. Acidity and ripe raspberries show strongly, as well as crisp final acidity. Drink now.",Château de la Roulerie 2014 La Camélias  (Rosé de Loire)
"This wine has ripe red fruit flavors, a dry core, balanced tannins and plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.

This blend is Merlot (60%), Carmenère (15%), Petit Verdot (15%) and Malbec (10%).",Château la Croix de Roche 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur

"This wine is light and fruity, well balanced with plenty of red berry flavors and only light tannins. It will be fresh and ready to drink from late 2016.

"With plenty of weight to support the ripe fruits, this is a balanced, perfumed wine. It has structure and tannins, along with fresh black currant flavors in the 80/20 Merlot/Cabernet Sauvignon blend. Drink from 2016.",Château Roc Montalon 2013  Bordeaux Supérieur
"This soft, gentle sparkling wine is fresh with raspberry fruits and acidity at the end. Drink as an apéritif.",Château Saint-Pierre NV Saint-Pierre Rosé Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux)

Light aromas of passion fruit and grapefruit are followed by tropical flavors that linger. It's an easy drinking quaffer.,14 Hands 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Washington)

"This blend is green and herbal up front. Following the nose, the palate is solid and chewy, but raw.

This is 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Carmenère and Merlot.",Balduzzi 2012 Grand Reserve Red (Maule Valley)

"Reserved aromas of spice, pear and lychee are followed by medium-sweet flavors. Pair it with yellow curry.",Two Vines 2014 Gewürztraminer (Washington)

"Low in oak and high in acidity, this wine skews tart and high-strung in terms of citrus and wet stone-like notions, offering a bouquet of lemon chiffon. A nice entry and finish surround a less-intriguing middle.",Ministry of the Vinterior 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Jammy black-fruit aromas are woody, reduced and come across cheesy. A thick, tannic, oaky body is home to flavors of plastic, creamy oak, vanilla and charred berries. This is pasty, oaky and creamy on the finish.",Montes 2012 La Finca Clos D'Angel Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"This doesn't taste true to the grape variety, but it's a good white wine with orange peel, jasmine and tangerine aromas, fairly quiet fruit flavors and then a floral, citrus finish. Light to medium bodied, it has an appetizing texture.",One Leaf 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"Light aromas of herbs, woodspice, tire rubber and red fruit lead to jammy raspberry and spice flavors that provide easy drinking pleasure.",Sagelands 2013 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now.

"This opens with funky but not unpleasant aromas that soon burn off to reveal earthy notes and mature black fruit.

While the ripe fruit still has immediate appeal, this is getting tired, so drink soon.",Trabucchi d'Illasi 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella

"Made in the style of a southern Rhône blend (half Viognier and one quarter each Marsanne and Roussanne), this is lightly lemony, with a bit more fat in the middle.

"Like a lemon-cream pastry in a bottle, this low-yield, hillside-grown wine has buttery, creamy aromas, rich almond and bright lemon flavors and a soft, nearly sweet finish. Not too full-bodied, it's a bit lighter in texture than many, because of that fresh lemony acidity to buoy it up.",Alder Springs 2013 Signature Chardonnay (Mendocino)

"This energized white wine has a German accent. Aromas recall honey, honeysuckle, tart apple and pineapple, and the flavors are like orange zest—tart, crisp and slightly bitter in a good way. This blend of Kerner, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Bacchus grapes should be brilliant with rich shellfish. It was barrel-fermented in 60% new oak, which one can't so much taste as feel subtly.",Borra 2012 Markus Nimmo White (California)

"New wood shows strongly in this perfumed, Merlot-dominated wine. It is structured and still very tight and tannic at this stage.

Drink from 2018.",Château Teyssier 2012  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"The small area of Pez is one of the top sites in Saint-Estèphe, with many highly rated chateaus. This is one. New wood aging shows strongly at this stage, although so does the fruit.

"From a 10-acre site called Scopus farmed by Ulises Valdez, this wine is rich and golden in color, given time to barrel-ferment and develop layers of fulsome complexity.

Concentrated and complex it finishes dry, lingering in beautiful layers on the tongue.",Paul Hobbs 2012 Ellen Lane Estate Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Artadi's top wine is dynamite in a bottle. Ripe, saturated, oaky aromas of blackberry, leather, blueberry pie and aged cheese are incredibly potent and alluring. This is huge in the mouth, with lemony oak and broad tannins that don't grind. Intense blackberry, coffee, toast and smoky flavors finish a mile deep, with all sorts of textural grab and character. Best from 2016 through 2026.",Artadi 2011 Viña El Pison  (Rioja)
"This structured wine opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, underbrush, leather, cedar, bright berries and baking spices.

Drink 2020–2040.",Giacomo Fenocchio 2010 Villero  (Barolo)
"Aromas of Mediterranean herbs, hay, leather and red berry come together in this structured Barolo. Loaded with energy and intensity, it delivers creamy cherry-berry flavors layered with white pepper, clove, nutmeg and orange zest. It already has depth but needs time to develop complexity. Drink after 2022.",Giovanni Rosso 2010 Cerretta  (Barolo)
"It offers classic Nebbiolo scents of red berry, forest floor, violet, baking spices, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The juicy palate doles out bright red cherry, mint, sage and black pepper alongside firm but velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2016–2024.",Rizzi 2009 Boito Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Sourced from the best barrels made at the winery in 2013, this off-dry reserve checks in with roughly 30 g/L residual sugar, and plenty of acidity to more than balance it out. It's sweet, tart and sappy, with concentrated, juicy flavors of Meyer lemon, grapefruit and tangerine. It feels full-bodied and roundly fruity, then continues to extend itself with concentrated details of mineral and acid. A wine of exceptional power and length.",Trisaetum 2013 Estates Reserve Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of red rose, wild cherry, forest floor and a whiff of leather take center stage. The palate expresses ripe black cherry accented by vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa, clove, white pepper, balsamic herbs and subtle oak alongside firm tannins.

"Fresh in mouthwatering minerality, this is positively bright, balanced and layered in lingering notes of lemon curd, green apple and just-picked vanilla bean.

"Juicy red and black cherry, crushed raspberry, violet, white pepper, cinnamon and sage sensations all come together. Assertive tannins and exhilarating acidity balance out the intense fruit and spice flavors. It's still austere and tight but displays great breeding and serious aging potential. Drink after 2020.",Roccheviberti 2010 Rocche di Castiglione  (Barolo)
"A perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so. Aromas and flavors of brown sugar, mocha and roasted meat give way to raspberry compote, while the creamy texture and supple tannins conceal the wine's high alcohol level with ease.",Torbreck 2010 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)
"Black cherry, mint and white pepper aromas jump out of the glass along with a whiff of balsamic herbs. The intense palate boasts mouthwatering red cherry and strawberry flavors restrained by black pepper, cinnamon, clove, orange zest and a hint of eucalyptus.

Red currant, clove, cedar and pencil all appear around a full-bodied, leathery texture and dots of black pepper and sage.",Matanzas Creek 2012 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Only very slight citrus notes appear on the nose. The palate opens into soft fruitiness with slight hints of apricot and peach. The chief attraction, though, is a central, vivid theme of white pepper. This is light bodied but full of subtle charms.",Nastl 2015 Klassik Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Hints of white blossom mix with faint notes of pear to create a delicately balanced, fresh and spring-like wine that is as light as gossamer. This has verve and freshness, tender, blossomy aromatics and immense charm. Drink as soon as possible while its elderflower notes shimmer lastingly.",Nigl 2015 Gelber Muskateller (Niederösterreich)

Crisp red currant and plum dance around savory specks of cedar and toasty oak.",Patland 2012 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley)

"At this early stage, the oak is still prominent. Mocha and brown sugar mark the nose, the palate offers dark-roasted coffee bean notes and the finish seems rather dry and astringent. But dig deeper, and a core of cherry fruit comes into focus, fully ripened to silky tannins and just needing time to emerge. Drink 2018–2025.",Quartz Reef 2013 Bendigo Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Yellow grapefruit pith, white Asian pear flesh, cherimoya and crisp stonefruit elements show on the nose of this bottling, which also offers the typical touch of petrol. The palate is very pithy and high-toned, showing lemon rind, sour orange and sour apple on the finish.",Jekel 2014 Riesling (Monterey)

"Peppery iron-oxide notes dance alongside notions of blueberry and cherry. The colour is dark but the fruit is crunchy and fresh. There is drive and vividness at the core of this rustic, appetizing red. Tannins are present and give a pleasant but light grip. Fresh acidity provides even more focus. With food this will shine. Drink soon to enjoy its vividness.",Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Trie Rot Red (Burgenland)

The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors.",Gérard Bertrand 2014 Kosmos Organic Grapes Red (Vin de France)
"Nearly equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this dusty red also makes use of 26% Syrah, 3% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% unidentified as other. A straightforward wine, it's juicy in blackberry and chalky chocolate.",Gibbs 2012 Crossed Paths Dusty Red (Napa Valley)
"A blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of bluish-black fruit, exotic spice and a balsamic note. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberry, spiced blueberry, coffee and black pepper accompanied by assertive but fine-grained tannins.",Le Senate 2012 Cacinello Red (Marche)

"A very interesting wine, this is reserved but complex, not overtly fruity or buttery, but more intriguing than that. It smells lightly like lemon zest and hazelnuts, and tastes quietly concentrated, like peach skin and almonds.",Apriori 2014 Chardonnay (Mendocino)
"Grown inland, away from the sea's influence, this wine has a full-bodied character. Acidity cuts through the ripe red fruits and caramel and spice flavor. The wine is rich and full in the mouth, soft at the end.",Bernard Magrez 2015 Les Muraires Douce Vie Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"From a winery located below Bernal Heights in San Francisco, this wine offers rich aromas of thick, chewy Meyer lemon pith, lightly toasted sourdough bread, toasted almonds, struck match and the slightest hint of browned butter.

"Vivid pepper and rounded red plum notes are joined by hints of cinnamon—reminiscent of freshly baked plum tart. This is a soft, pliable but very full-fruited wine. Lovers of Pinot should definitely try St. Laurent—here it is in a very approacheble and supercharming, medium-bodied red.",The Dot 2014 Austrian Plum St. Laurent (Niederösterreich)
"Apple and melon aromas are clean, stony and direct. This feels juicy while also offering ample body weight. Tangerine and nectarine flavors finish long, minerally and ripe, with none of Albariño's common pithy bitterness.",Ramón Bilbao 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Stewy berry and melted chocolate aromas are ultra oaky and creamy. A tannic, heavy mouthfeel and borderline overripe flavors of prune, chocolate and tobacco finish raisiny and baked. Drink through 2020.",Salcis 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"A single vineyard expression from this winery's newish vineyard, this shows pressed purple flowers, deep blueberries and a touch of tar on the nose. The flavors are dense, dark and framed by strong tannins, with elderberry, pencil lead and deep lilac syrup gaining intrigue from white sage, white pepper and raw beef tones.",San Simeon 2012 St. Eva Hill Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth. Oaky notes of toast and blackened spice lend a chocolaty essence to berry and plum flavors, while this finishes with an herbal, spicy aftertaste.",Terrazas de Los Andes 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Lots of fresh apple flavors, a crisp balance and smooth mouthfeel make this light-bodied wine refreshing and fun to drink. It has some richness on the midpalate and finish, but basically keeps its lively, tangy personality going.",Avant 2014 Fresh Crisp Clean Chardonnay (California)
"Sharp aromas of peach blossoms, honeyed nuts and lemon balm make for a fruity yet biting nose on this blend of 58% Grenache Blanc from Happy Canyon and 42% Viognier from San Luis Obispo County. Ripened stonefruit flavors are cut with a sizzle of acidity and warmth of sea salt and candied Meyer lemon on the palate.",Barton 2014 The River White (Central Coast)
"A clear, light-bodied wine that's slightly reduced on the nose, this Spring Mountain site provides a tightness of black tea and cherry cola, with a leanness that's hard to miss. Leather, currant and baked bread add additional complexity and intrigue.",Brick & Mortar 2013 La Perla Vineyard Pinot Noir (Spring Mountain District)
"A 100% varietal wine entirely from Yountville, this presents a touch of herb and cedar on the entry aromatically, followed by a thickness of tannin that softens in the glass. Big-boned, it finishes strong in tobacco and coffee.",One 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"Simultaneously light yet earthy, this shows cherry pie, concentrated pomegranate, whole nutmeg, buttery crust and intriguing brown spices on the nose. There is a bit less action on the palate, but still plenty of tart cherries, tobacco and brown spice elements.",Pace 2013 Sebastiano Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Blueberry, grapeseed, leather, cigar box and concentrated lavender combine for an elegantly intriguing nose on this bottling from a winery between Morgan Hill and Gilroy. The palate is fresh and rather light, with plums, figs, crushed peppercorns and a forest floor/pine needle intrigue.",Jason-Stephens 2010 Estate Merlot (Santa Clara Valley)
"Fresh and tempting, this has a hot-pink color and flavors like watermelon and cherry. With medium body and even a light touch of tannin, it's more meaty than many rosés, so you can serve it with the meal as well as for an apéritif.",Las Positas 2014 Estate Rosé (Livermore Valley)
"Sanguine in cedar, pencil lead and tea, this wine's elegant opening gives way to ripe black fruit and thick, burly tannins. The finish is marked in vanilla oak and a taste of cigar.",In Re 2010 You be the judge! Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"Lightly smoked stone fruit and apple blossoms greet the nose on this bottling of 50% Marsanne and 50% Grenache Blanc. The palate is much more interesting, with lemon sorbet and ripe apples clinging to a steely centerline that shows flashes of flint and gunmetal.",Two Moons 2013 Aporia White (Paso Robles)
"Aromas of ripe berry, Mediterranean herb, menthol and eucalyptus lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate is already somewhat evolved offering blackberry extract, mature black cherry, licorice, spice and espresso alongside polished tannins. It closes on a note of bitter walnut.",Valle dell'Acate 2012  Cerasuolo di Vittoria Classico
"This long-aged blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Petite Sirah is plump on the oaky nose with condensed rose petal, chocolate cake and violet aromas. The palate starts with ripe black cherries but then settles into an asphalt-laden midpalate, finishing with chocolate-chip cookies and a graphite tension.",Volatus 2008 Reserve Red (Paso Robles)
"Playful and nearly effervescent on the nose with lemon-lime soda notes and a sparkling pear-cider character, this bottling also shows aromas of pink grapefruit and pink lemonade sorbet. Tart lime and lemon verbena pop on the palate as does melon pith, with a slight herbal character on the finish.",Zocker 2014 Paragon Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Edna Valley)
"There is a high-toned aspect to the otherwise neutral nose that just gives away lemony hints. The palate is sprightly and fresh and reveals a very creamy, fruity, almost tropical core which is cut very pleasantly by fresh, aromatic lemon—this is Chardonnay but not as you know it. A very fruity, rich but fresh number.",Hannes Reeh 2014 Rohstoff Chardonnay (Burgenland)
"This wine could be labeled a Cabernet Sauvignon, which makes up 83% of the blend, with the rest Merlot. The aromas of fruit leather, dried blackberry, black licorice and medicine cabinet are bright, though they seem considerably more evolved than the wine's age might indicate. The black-fruit flavors display a sense of balance that carries through the finish. Drink now.",Hightower 2012 Reserve Red (Red Mountain)
"Already six years old, this wine offers aromas of black licorice, dried cherry, vanilla, clove and abundant wood spices.

"Merlot (55%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (40%) make up the majority of this wine with the balance Malbec. Vanilla, barrel spice and dark-fruit aromas are followed by saturated black-fruit flavors that linger. The oak gets a bit out-front but the wine still has much to offer.",Stottle 2012 Big Eddie Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Blue-fruit aromas intermingle with vanilla and other barrel spices. The coffee and plum flavors are full and supple in feel, followed by a tart finish. The wood seems a bit primary but the fruit and feel is still hard to ignore.",Stottle 2012 Elerding 6 Prong Malbec (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Bright aromas of freshly roasted coffee beans, brown stems, dried herbs, purple flowers, mineral and black pepper are followed by ethereally light fruit and savory flavors that focus on elegance.

"The aromas of flowers, mineral, peach and almond are initially light but pleasing. The stone-fruit flavors are full bodied and sweet, pulling up ever so slightly on the finish.",àMaurice 2014 Boushey Vineyard Marsanne-Viognier (Yakima Valley)
"Les Collines and Stone Valley fruit make up 75% of this wine with the rest coming from Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge and Summit View. It offers generous aromas of blueberry puree, dried herbs, red fruit, woodspice, dried flowers and mineral. The flavors bring the same but are more pulled-back than the aromas suggest, with a bit of astringency that holds the wine back.",Amavi 2013 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth.",Brian Carter Cellars NV One Upland Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Snipes Mountain)
"Specks of rosemary give the aromatic entry of this wine a nice herbal invitation. This subtlety is followed by more bombastic waves of big, juicy black cherry, berry and oak. The tannins are still substantial, suggesting cellaring, through 2021.",Charthia 2013 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"The gravel soil on this Lévèque family property makes a great place to grow white grapes. A 50/50 blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, this fresh wine suggests the ability to age. It is fruity now, hinting at apricots as well as citrus. It can be drunk now for its freshness, although wait until late 2016 for it to develop greater depths.",Château de Chantegrive 2013  Graves
"Spice and ripe fruit, with attractive tannins and a soft texture. This wine is open, generous, rich and packed with black currant fruitiness. Give this wine another 2–4 years, but it could well be drinkable sooner.",Château Mayne Vieil 2011 Cuvée Aliénor  (Fronsac)
"This is a crisp, but also rich style of Federspiel. It is full of ripe pear and apple flavor as well as a fine pinch of pepper. Acidity creeps in the background to balance this ready-to-drink wine. Screwcap.",F X Pichler 2012 Loibner Klostersatz Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now–2020+.",Frankland Estate 2012 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River)
"This is a serious wine, despite the ripe fruitiness on its surface. It is full of peach and mango flavors, but structured by a cool, mineral feel. Tangy acidity and tight texture adds tension. It still needs to age 2–4 years. Screwcap.",Graf Hardegg 2010 Steinbügel Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)

"Single vineyard, 100% varietal Malbec can be spot on, and this succeeds with a balanced flavor profile of mixed berries and earthy tannins. There's a hint of volatility, that quickly blows off. Decanting for an hour or so is advised.",àMaurice 2010 Gamache Vineyard Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This traditionally styled Barolo has a classic fragrance of violet, rose and leather, with balsamic notes. The palate reveals ripe berry and spice with notes of pipe tobacco and while the acidity is tame the wine is massively tannic. Hold this for a few more years, but drink it before 2020.",Barale Fratelli 2009 Bussia  (Barolo)
"This shows enticing aromas of mint, spice and balsamic herbs and delivers a restrained palate of black cherry, with undertones of sage, white pepper, coffee and espresso. This is still aggressively tannic and needs time to soften.",Barale Fratelli 2009 Castellero  (Barolo)

"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish. It's Port-like in flavor, but without the heat from elevated alcohol. Drink it over the next few years.",Hope Estate 2010 The Ripper Shiraz (Geographe)

"This is a balanced and complex fifty-fifty blend, with herbal accents of licorice root, coffee bean and foliage that mingle harmoniously with ripe fruit notes of blackberry, wild raspberry and cherry.

"There's a lot to like in this effort: ample dark fruit, complex notions of tea leaves and dried grasses, and a richly textured, long finish. The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8–10 years.",Robert Oatley 2009 Finisterre Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)

"La Clarine Farm's rosé is slightly cloudy, sourced mostly from Syrah grapes, with unusual additions of Mourvèdre, Sémillon and Viognier. Winemaker Hank Beckmeyer says the Syrah grapes barely ripen and that's why he likes them for this wine. Light at 12.8% alcohol, it's an intriguing melange of earthy dark strawberry and mint, crisp in acidity.",La Clarine Farm 2012 Rosé (Sierra Foothills)
"Oak, resin, vanilla and creamy aromas run side by side with cherry, cassis and berry scents on this blend of Cabernet, Carmenère, Petit Verdot and Syrah.

Drink through 2017.",La Playa 2010 Axel Primero Red (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a rich, robust Pinot Noir, defining the big, tannic style. It explodes in cherry, cola and pomegranate fruit flavors, with the added note of caramelized oak. You can drink this wine now, but it should hold in the bottle for 6–8 years, gradually mellowing. The vineyard is in the cooler southern part of the valley, near Carneros.",Maldonado 2011 Los Olivos Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.,Medlock Ames 2008 Bell Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Earthy aromas include pencil eraser, wild herbs and eucalyptus along with tea and blackberry. This is very smooth and lush in the mouth, a reflection of a warm vintage.

A lightly herbal and spicy tasting finish with medium intensity fades away with lactic creaminess.",Ochagavia 2010 Raices Nobles Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, this is a classic example of Wahluke Slope Syrah. Well-integrated layers of citrus, berry, roasted coffee beans, vanilla cookie and Graham cracker combine into a most accessible, yet complex wine. It's ready to drink, and should be consumed over the next 3–4 years.",Barnard Griffin 2011 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Thick, heavy, potent and mouth-coating, this is a liquorous, almost syrupy wine, sure to please those who like big fruit, big tannins, and big barrel flavors. Chocolate, espresso, tar and bourbon barrel flavors dominate, in keeping with the house style.",Barrister 2009 Bacchus Vineyard Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lots of muscle in this punchy Sauvignon Blanc, with its ripe lemon, lime, orange and papaya flavors, made bright by crisp acidity. Despite a streak of honey, the finish is dry. Additional richness is provided by barrel fermentation and the addition of a little Sémillon.",Bougetz 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea. This is medium to full in weight, with a mouthwatering, velvety finish that belies its price point. Drink now–2020+.",West Cape Howe 2009 Book Ends Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia)
"This is a blend of 67% Syrah and 33% Cabernet Sauvignon from Red Willow and Dineen, respectively. Though it falls on the lighter side for Washington Syrah, it's proportionate and pleasing, with strawberry fruit, mocha and toast. Tannins are fine and slender; though drinking well now, this could be cellared for awhile longer.",William Church 2010 2 Spires Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tantalizing spice notes mix with aromas of quince and lanolin on this fabulous bargain Riesling. While intensely tropical on the palate, it's remarkably nuanced with hints of potpourri, white flowers, and a sharp, steely acidity. Perfect as an aperitif, or paired with spicy, herbaceous Asian cuisine.",Karl Kaspar 2010 Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"With 12% Sémillon in the blend, this is a lovely, fresh, almost exuberant Sauvignon Blanc. Bracing and textural, with good varietal character but no excessive herbaceousness, it's loaded with fruit flavors of melon, grapefruit, kiwi and apple. A fine mix of precision and length.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley)
"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium.",Pillitteri 2004 Fusion Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
"Smooth and medium-bodied, with modest cherry scents and cassis and tobacco flavors. Soft and lacking energy on the finish, but clean.",Black Swan 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
"Lightly brambled and ever so slightly green, with pleasant strawberry and raspberry aromas. The mouthfeel is a touch choppy and grabby, but it's not too thin and rough to make it unpleasant. Not bad for the price.",Funky Llama 2007 Tempranillo (Mendoza)
"The wine's garnet ruby color is so saturated, it seems more like a light red than a rosato and the aromas recall raspberry, white almond, peppermint and a hint of Sherry.",Borgo di Colloredo 2005 Gironia Biferno Rosato Red (Molise)
"Creamy and fresh on the nose and followed by a play of good acidity and body, this Riesling from New Jersey is both supple and refreshing. The flavors fall a bit flat though—and need more dimension.",Alba 2005 Dry Riesling (New Jersey)
"Harsh and hot, with chili pepper, mint and thinned-down blackberry and cherry flavors.",Congress Springs 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"You'll find sweet and sour flavors in this wine, like in a LifeSaver lemon candy. The best part is the acidity, which is tart, and keeps the wine balanced.",Congress Springs 2006 Viognier (Lodi)
"Soft and sweet, with canned apricot and syrupy peach flavors.",Jenica Peak 2006 Coastal Series Pinot Grigio (California)
"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing.",Norman 2006 Reserve Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Pride continues to struggle with this variety, as does everyone else in California who tries their hand at it. The '05 is semisweet and simple, with candied cherry-blackberry flavors that finish more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",Pride Mountain 2005 Sangiovese (Sonoma County)
"With 15.5% alcohol, this wine is too hot for balance. It also tastes unnecessarily sweet, with sugared raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors.",Mazzocco 2005 Stone Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",Congress Springs 2006 Chardonnay (California)
"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish.",Emerson 2006 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Barbecue is your best bet with this rustic Zin. It's lusty in jammy blackberry, mulberry and vanilla spice flavors that finish with a definite sugariness.",Four Vines 2005 Maverick Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",Four Vines 2005 Old Vine Cuvée Zinfandel (California)
"A drink-now style of warming Shiraz, with plenty of weight and richness, soft tannins and flavors that artfully combine sour plum, cracked pepper, rare beef and chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.",Hesketh 2008 Usual Suspects Shiraz (McLaren Vale)

"Although known in the Douro as an increasingly essential component of Port and table wines, the Touriga Nacional is equally at home in the Dão. As here, it produces linear wines, very mineral, full of acidity with a perfumed elegance. This is a wine for aging over 4–5 years.",Borges 2009 Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"Merlot (70%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot make for a smooth and rich wine with candied fruit, blueberry, spice and loads of sweet cherry. It's chewy and tight in the mouth, with polished, almost squeaky tannins and impressive length.",Caccia al Piano 1868 2009 Ruit Hora  (Bolgheri)

"Dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, the wine is packed with dusty tannins. Mint flavors show the wood aging while black currant boosts the fruit side of the wine. It is rich, its fruit very ripe yet also elegant.",Château Lieujean 2009  Haut-Médoc
"A wine that shows rich blackberry fruits, already rounded and soft. It has a tannic structure that is embedded in the fruit, along with spice, toast and a firm finish. An ageworthy wine.",Château Liversan 2009  Haut-Médoc
"A solid Petite Sirah. You can use it in a wine education class as a textbook example of the variety. It's full bodied, tannic and rich in blackberry, blueberry, crème de cassis, cola, grilled meat and black pepper flavors, enhanced by oak. Should age effortlessly, without gaining complexity, for many years.",J. Rickards 2009 Brown Barn Vineyard Petite Sirah (Alexander Valley)

"Fresh berry, mint, cola and herb aromas make for a classic Maipo bouquet. Feels fresh and good, with plying tannins and bright acidity. Tastes earthy, mossy and herbal, with ample berry fruit. Licorice and prune flavors carry the finish. Syrah with Cabernet, Carmenère and Petit Verdot.",Antiyal 2009 Kuyen Red (Maipo Valley)
"Each Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result. It's medium in body, with notes of grilled pineapple and sweet corn and a brisk, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 6–9 months.",Jacob's Creek 2009 Reserve Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"You won't find many wines made with the Pugnitello grape (a native variety of Tuscany) and that's what is special about this bottle. The wine shows ripe fruit, blackberry and a soft, velvety texture.",Le Buche 2008 Olivi Cantine Pugnitello (Toscana)
"All black cherry and blueberry jam, this South Coast Syrah is fruity and spicy, full and fleshy with pepper and cinnamon spice and a teaspoon of black tea playfully showing through. Consistent throughout, a wine that's easy to like and complex at the same time. It spent close to two years in French oak, 30% of it new.",Leonesse Cellars 2008 Vista Del Monte Vineyard Syrah (Temecula Valley)
"A really good value in a California Chardonnay. Blended with a touch of Viognier to add brightness, and fermented in a little new oak, it hits just the right notes for today's popular taste. Slightly sweet in buttered toast and pineapple jam flavors, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a stony minerality.",Liberty School 2010 Chardonnay (Central Coast)

"As before, this is Weinbau vineyard fruit. The 2009 vintage seems to have presented some challenges, as the fruit flavors suggest uneven ripening, with a mix of tutti-fruity candy flavors along with some raisins. Tannins are smooth and there's a pleasing streak of graphite running through the finish. Drink soon.",Nefarious 2009 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"Broadly fruity, this dark and smooth Merlot is loaded with a luscious mix of black fruits. The flavors play out in forward, accessible fashion, flecked with a pleasing minerality.",O•S Winery 2009 The Tusk Elephant Mountain Vineyard Merlot (Yakima Valley)

"A wild, herbal, wood-aged wine, its acidity a fine foil to the richly perfumed fruit. Pears and sweet melon come together with the toast of the wood. At this stage, the wood dominates and needs a year to soften—then the result will be impressively food-friendly.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2009 Branco Cerceal (Beiras)
"The aroma shines with Syrah perfumes, while the palate brings together great ripe perfumed and spiced fruit, smooth, rich and dense. There is just an earthy element that needs to soften over the next two years.",Quinta do Cavalinho 2009 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo)
"A wine that starts out all tannins. The fruit takes a while to show through and then produces juicy red cherry flavors and considerable acidity, the wood aging rounding the corners. This is for medium-term aging.",Rozes 2008 Quinta do Grifo Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"Despite its youth, Moreccio (a blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) really delivers the goods.

It's smooth, beautifully soft and caresses the palate.",Casa di Terra 2010 Moreccio  (Bolgheri)

"Dominated by Merlot, this is a fruity and rich wine, rounded, ripe and spicy. It has density and weight, layered with dusty rich tannins. With its spice, blackberry acidity and chunky feel, it is already drinkable, but will age over several years.",Château Laforge 2009  Saint-Émilion
"A wine from a château that is still finding its form . It is soft, open, with attractive juicy red fruits and black currants, ready to drink soon.",Château Soutard 2009  Saint-Émilion

While it shows some complexity, it's fast approaching its optimum drinking window, so enjoy soon.",Zymè 2006  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"As big as you expect a Howell Mountain Zin to be, offering rich, deep blackberry, currant, chocolate, licorice, bacon and cedar flavors that are sweet and dry at the same time. It's not just powerful in flavor, it's wonderful in structure, with refined tannins and balancing acidity. A minor criticism is some heat from alcohol, but that's the nature of ripe Zinfandel.",Howell Mountain Vineyards 2010 Old Vine Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"Conflict is two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc. Smoke wreathes around deep cherry candy flavors, leading into some chewy tannins dusted with savory herbs.",J. Bookwalter 2010 Conner Lee Vineyard Conflict Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This lush Chardonnay has a certain oiliness to the aromas, along with dusty, toasty components that ride through a soft, plush mid-palate. The fruit is a rich mix of peach and apricot, highlighted with toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and coconut.",Januik 2011 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dry spice is fighting with rich, smooth Chardonnay to give a wine that is unbalanced at the moment. It is full, fragrant, still young so the dried almond edge should melt into the more honeyed character. Drink from 2017.",Umathum 2011 Beerenauslese White (Burgenland)
"This is rich in black cherry flavors, with layered accents of white pepper, almond and walnut. It's the perfect marriage between the elegance of Valpolicella and the structure of Amarone. Imported by Panebianco, Vinity Wine Company.",Venturini Massimino 2009 Semonte Alto  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"This sparkling wine is one of the best from Chandon in years. There's a soft refinement to the mousse, making it just as good as its more expensive rivals. Shows complex flavors of yeast, limes, oranges, vanilla and honey.",Chandon 2008 Vintage Brut Sparkling (Yountville)
"This Cab Franc is rich and ripe in red and black currants and cherries, with a mocha sweet earthiness leading to sweet oak buttered cinnamon toast and a slight caramelization. It's dry and smooth in tannins. Best of all is an acidity and minerality that lend structure. Drink now–2015.",Frazier 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"Ripe, jammy black-fruit sensations dominate the nose and mouth of this wine, with lush, expressive notes of blackberry, black raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The texture is like crushed satin, with medium-plus yet fine tannins and a cocoa-kissed finish. Enjoyable now, but should develop additional complexities after 2016.",Domaine Cabirau 2011 Serge & Nicolas Red (Maury Sec)
"Give this Cabernet high marks for sheer lusciousness. It's ripe in blackberries, black cherries and currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Not a longterm ager, so drink over the next five years.",Frias 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"This is a concentrated, firm and tannic wine. It has a structured feel from Chiroubles, which are the highest vineyards in Beaujolais. With its black fruits, dark tannins and concentrated texture, it could certainly age for 2–3 years, although it is ready to drink now.",Georges Duboeuf 2011 Domaine des Pontheux  (Chiroubles)
"Showing some mature notes at the age of four years or so, with a mellow texture framing cherry pie, cola and spice flavors. Feels silky, lush and delightful. Drink now–2015 as the fruit gradually fades away.",Orentano 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

"This is vibrant and expressive, with upfront purple-flower fragrances of violet and iris mixed with fruity tones of boysenberry and raspberry sauce. The crushed-silk texture offers medium tannins, ample acidity and skin-driven fruit flavors. Roasted coffee bean and sweet smoke accents mark the lingering finish.",Les Villages de Terroir Catalan 2010 Red (Côtes du Roussillon Villages Caramany)
"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit.",J. Bookwalter 2010 Foreshadow Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Leaner and tighter than this bottling has been the previous few vintages, this wine is showing hard tannins obscure in plum, black cherry pie and mocha flavors. Yet it's a balanced wine, which should develop bottle complexity after 2016.",Keller Estate 2010 La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"L'Ecole tackles, with great success, two of the least-recognized strengths of Washington viticulture: Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. Here the blend includes 13% Sauvignon Blanc. It's well built, full bodied, with a mix of citrus and stone fruits, generous acidity, and some finishing skin flavors putting a slightly bitter frame around it.",L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This wine is mostly Sémillon, with Sauvignon Blanc filling in the rest. It's one of the rare white wines from the Walla Walla AVA, graceful, full-bodied and tasting of fig and green banana. Just recently bottled, it still carries a bit of yeast in the nose and in the finish. Give it another few months to pull itself together.",L'Ecole No. 41 2012 Seven Hills Vineyard Estate Luminesce Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Walla Walla Valley (WA))

"Inox is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay, the first of the vintage. This bottling provides a promising glimpse into the quality of the 2012s.

Try now with sushi, tuna tartare, or a salad of bitter greens, tropical fruits and feta cheese.",Melville 2012 Clone 76 Inox Estate Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A larger selection from Signal Ridge, Bravium's main bottling is still tiny production, light on its feet and aromatic in rose petal and violet. With notes of black cherry and pomegranate its tannins are silky and the wine deliciously priced.",Bravium 2011 Signal Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino Ridge)
"Givry is one of the unsung values in Burgundy. This ripe and structured wine shows why. It has weight, a firm texture and red plum and strawberry fruit flavors. All these elements are held together by a dark sense of tannin and fine acidity.",Antonin Rodet 2010  Givry
"Earthy, mildly leafy aromas of dried red fruits and vanilla are textbook for Rioja gran reserva. A medium-bodied palate shows balsamic richness along with flavors of prune, raisin, cassis and loamy earth. This is mild but solid on the finish, with a quick fade to the fruit component. Drink now.",Bodegas Muriel 2004 Viña Muriel Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"This muscular Amarone has an almost overripe fragrance, along with chocolate and vanilla notes. The alcohol is forward on the palate, but it also delivers sweet plum, prune and black pepper flavor, with hints of vanilla and coffee. This is direct and powerfully structured.",Zenato 2007 Sergio Zenato Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"his blend has a spicy character, balanced with acidity and a ripe, full honeyed character. On the dry side, it has richness, pepper and a deep texture that demands aging. Drink from 2017.",Heidi Schröck 2010 Ruster Ausbruch White (Burgenland)

The palate is rich, chocolaty and seamlessly stitched together.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2010 Canoe Ridge Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)

"Rich in black cherry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors, this wine offers the firm tannins and minerality that give a young Spring Mountain Cabernet its noticeable characteristics. Give it eight years to begin to come around.",Eponymous 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"This brut-style bubbly is comprised of 67% Pinot Noir and 33% Chardonnay and shows aspects of both varieties. It's fairly full bodied, with raspberry, strawberry, lime, brioche, vanilla and toast flavors. Feels elegant, complex and lush in the mouth, and should develop additional bottle notes over the next six years.",Gloria Ferrer 2005 Royal Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros)
"This is a good example of the high-alcohol style of warmth and deliciousness. While it's not common for Stags Leap wines to have these characteristics, it is incredibly deep in black cherries, milk chocolate and oak, with a spicy finish that goes on for a long time, indicating the power of this Cabernet. Drink over the next six years.",Hall 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Unexpectedly thick and mouthfilling, with generous peach aromas and flavors underscored by mustard greens and citrus. Clean and refreshing on the finish. Best Buy.",Geretto 2001 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)

Everything works here, including the smooth, lengthy finish.  Best Buy.",La Playa 2002 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"Smooth smelling, with pure and fresh berry and plum aromas. Very young and a bit tangy on the palate, with cherry and berry flavors and an oaky, soft finish that goes sweet then sour, and lasts for a long time. In terms of structure, it's balanced, mildly tannic, yet meant for drinking now.",Undurraga 2001 Reserva Merlot (Maipo Valley)
"The “least” of Lane Tanner's range of Pinots, but complex and delicious. Ripe berry and spice flavors are rich, and there's a tangy earthiness suggesting sauteed mushrooms. Very dry and crisp, with a silky texture and a long, smooth finish.",Lane Tanner 2000 Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"From an emerging Mendocino appellation, an engaging, dry wine. Its mouth-cleansing acidity is fresh and clean, highlighting pretty flavors of lime and honeydew, and leads to a tart finish.",Lolonis 2001 Fumé Blanc (Redwood Valley)
"Simple, delicate and fruity, a jammy style with sweetly ripe flavors of wild raspberries and strawberries, as well as espresso, tobacco and Oriental spices. It's light and silky on the palate.",River Road 2001 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Creamy aromas of vanilla and pears also carry some typical Sauvignon Blanc pungency. For a rounder style, which it is, it's quite refreshing. The mix across the palate of banana, grapefruit and almonds is attractive, and so is the round, pretty finish. Drink it very soon.",Santa Ines 2001 Legado de Armida Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley)
"Lean and angular right now, showing hints of mint and chocolate—the oak sticks out a bit over the tart cherry flavors.",Sebastiani 1996 Cherryblock Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"A good wine, grape-wise, with sharply etched, pure fruity flavors of citrus, fig and sweet tobacco. Acidity is fresh and juicy, and the wine is fully dry. Barrel fermented, it is super-oaky, maybe too much so, from the charry aromas to the woody flavors.",Signorello 2001 Seta Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This is a full-bodied Pinot, packed with ripe cherry and strawberry flavors and framed in spicy nuance. A shade hot on the finish, ending with an unusually bright licorice and herbal edge.",Silver 2000 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"An open-knit, friendly nose features lots of nectarine and ripe apple scents. Medium-weight, with plenty of stone fruit on the palate, it finishes with a cleansing burst of peppery spice. Try as an apéritif.",Bortoluzzi 2001 Pinot Grigio (Isonzo del Friuli)
"This is a great house pour for fans of Chilean Merlot with its consistent fruit, soft acidity and low tannins. On the nose and palate, a core of sweet, Red Delicious apple is accented by dry leather, toasty vanilla and dried herbs. Simple, but well crafted.",Château La Joya 2000 Estate Bottled Reserve Merlot (Colchagua Valley)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot starts off a bit murky and brooding but then displays raspberry and plum fruit, and some big-time heft. A tad oaky and simple, but with grilled meats it should more than do the trick. If you like 'em big and a touch funky, get tattooed.",Two Brothers 2001 Big Tattoo Red Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Heavy and gold in color, with aromas of browned butter, wheat and corn cakes. The bouquet and color are heavy, and so is the palate: There you get oak barrel and toast, but little to no fruit. Even the finish is woody, with just a hint of melon and banana. A good experimental wine for those eager to taste oak; otherwise steer clear.",Viña Santa Monica 2001 Chardonnay (Rapel Valley)
"The new clone on the block finally makes it onto the front label. Soft and silky, this wine has cherry-berry flavors with an earthy streak of tobacco and sage. There are some firm tannins that kick in on the finish, which suggest six months of aging.",Wolff 2001 Dijon Clones Selection Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"The initial nosing reveals a char-broiled character along with maple. That nose turns even darker with airing, indicating that no barrel was spared in the making of this wine. The flavor profile is all dark berries and cream, with yet more wood at the heart. On the tail end, it's dry, broad and full of tannins and extract that coat the mouth. Best Buy.",Errazuriz 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Aconcagua Valley)
"A rich, aromatic, honeyed style of Chardonnay, with 100% malolactic fermentation to increase the softness and sweet wood flavors. Soft peach flavors increase the tropical intensity of the wine.",Girolamo Dorigo 2000 Chardonnay (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"As easy and tasty as a summer wine gets, this blush also has a lovely coppery-pink color. Flavors of fresh strawberries and spice burst on the palate, and drink just a tad off-dry.",Iron Horse 2002 Rose de Pinot Noir Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"From a vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands, a young, jammy wine bursting with candied flavors of raspberries and cherries. It drinks very concentrated and intense. There's a caramelly note that may come from well-charred barrels in this dry, full-bodied wine.",Opolo 2000 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Tasty and wonderfully drinkable. The basic flavors are cola and soy, with extra nuances of blackberries, cherries and quite a bit of smoky, sweet oak. Drinks very dry and spicy.",Savannah-Chanelle 2000 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A taut, citrusy and minerally wine from a grape variety that's often more open and fruity, this offering is nonetheless impeccably fresh and clean, picking up some minty notes on the finish.",Merk 2001 Tocai (Friuli Aquileia)
"Some earthy, herbal cranberry scents are given life by a touch of smoky oak. The palate is sweet and wholesome, and very well balanced. The finish gives a hint of syrup and oak, but the fruit is ripe and succulent enough to handle that.",Morandé 2001 Edicion Limitada - 66 Barricas Cabernet Franc (Maipo Valley)

It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",J Vineyards & Winery 2002 Pinot Gris (Russian River Valley)
"Despite the modest price, this wine needs some time in the glass or in a decanter to open up. It starts off slowly, then builds pear and quince aromas and flavors through the long, tart, minerally finish. Best Buy.",Pradio 1999 Teraje Chardonnay (Friuli Grave)
"A Soave that has been partially barrel fermented is unusual, but it works in this wine, which has great concentration, roundness and softness and the complexity of toast.",Masi 2002 Colbaraca Classico  (Soave)
"This luscious, balanced Pinot Grigio isn't overly complex, but scores for its cactus pear and toasted almond aromas and flavors and its peppery, refreshing finish. It's medium-bodied, with just a hint of unreleased CO2 to enliven it.",Masottina 2001 Vigneto Ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave)
"Solid and sturdy, and more big than small, this Syrah runs toward the red-fruit spectrum. But the nose offers dried fruit, herbs and clove, while there's more clove and fennel underneath the fruit on the palate. There's oak throughout, especially on the finish, but it's not overdone. And if many Syrah-based wines need time to settle, this one seems made for immediate drinking.",Montes 2001 Alpha Syrah (Curicó Valley)
"This Merlot excels beyond its bargain classification by showing purity and a high level of fruit quality. The bouquet exudes plum, chocolate and some creaminess, while the palate bursts with blackberry, bitter chocolate and espresso. Round and satisfying, with enough structure to last a year or two—or until the next vintage comes around.",Concha y Toro 2002 Xplorador Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"Friendly apple fruit sits easily on nose and palate before a refreshing, clean finish. This is an easy, fruit-driven white ideal for a party.",Dopff & Irion 2014 Cuvée René Dopff Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Made from the local Sciaccarellu grape, this is a delicious, light and perfumed wine. It has tight acidity to go with the red currant flavors and the crisp texture. The wine is poised and refreshing.",Union de Vignerons de l'Île de Beauté 2015 Rosé (Ile de Beauté)
"Lively aromas like crisp apple and white peach join more creamy, pastry-like flavors of butter, vanilla and toasted almond in this medium-bodied wine. It is soft in texture and so fruity it seems sweet on the finish.",Van Ruiten 2015 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"This wine is tangy and textured with light tannins, a bite of citrus acidity and plenty of fruit. It's bright and has a juicy, lively aftertaste. Drink now.",Vignobles Bonhur 2015 Château Terres Douces Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Largely neutral on the nose, then tangy and still fresh on the palate, this drink-now Viura is clean but unexciting. Flavors of generic citrus finish firm, with a pithy aftertaste.",Viña Otano 2014 Viura (Rioja)
"Aromas suggesting honeydew melon, exotic fruit and a hint of tomato leaf lead the nose. The simple palate is a bit less expressive, offering grapefruit and a hint of white peach alongside lively acidity.",MandraRossa 2015 Urra di Mare Sauvignon (Sicilia)
"Made with white vinification of Aglianico grapes, this has aromas of dried-up chamomile flower and overripe citrus fruit. The simple palate offers crushed white currant alongside zesty acidity.",Mastroberardino 2013 Neroametà Aglianico (Campania)
"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",Joseph Filippi 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (Cucamonga Valley)
"A pleasant mix of dark berries and fruit lead the bouquet of this friendly wine, with solid notes of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry throughout. A hint of spice adds interest to the finish, with medium-light tannins and ample acidity resulting in good overall balance.",Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pays d'Oc)
"A softly earthy tone is all the nose gives away. The palate is brisk, neutral and has both freshness and a slightly bitter edge. Drink soon.",Leon Beyer 2014 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Toasted oak, citrus zest and honey aromas lead followed by a balsamic note. The palate offers walnut, oak and the barest hint of butterscotch but it lacks fruit richness.",Terredora 2012 Campore  (Fiano di Avellino)
"This medium-bodied wine is very fruity in aroma, and exudes ripe pear and fig flavors. Add in creamy vanilla accents and a very soft texture and the effect is almost sweet.",Tortoise Creek 2014 Jam's Blend Chardonnay (Lodi)
"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme.",Undurraga 2014 Gran Reserva Sibaris Pinot Noir (Leyda Valley)
"This is a juicy and formidably tannic version of the variety, from a famed vineyard known also for Zinfandel. Dry oak and intrusively harsh texture need mellowing before the more gentle notions of dried herb and black cherry can shine.",Vermeil 2013 Frediani Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Calistoga)
"Apple and citrus aromas are neither well defined nor overly aromatic. Fresh and juicy on the palate, this offers citrus peel and green melon flavors. Mild and short on the finish.",Viña Maipo 2015 Vitral Chardonnay (Chile)
A soft fruitiness and smooth texture make this medium-bodied red easy to enjoy. Strawberry and cherry notes rest easily on a bed of light tannin that adds an appetizing mouthfeel.,Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2013 Merlot (California)
"Black cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate. Generic plum and berry flavors are pure, while this finishes plump, chunky and with a hint of chocolate.",Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2014 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Aromas of herbal red fruits, tobacco and vanilla are basic and modest. This has a wiry, acidic mouthfeel and flavors of mixed herbs, tomato, pie cherry, red plum and olive. A fresh, racy finish is tangy and tomatoey.",Concha y Toro 2014 Reserva Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"This might be a touch volatile at first, but saucy tomato-like aromas are offset by fresh red-plum notes. A tight and tannic palate softens with time in the glass, while berry flavors carry herb and spice notes onto a lightly herbal finish.",Echeverria 2014 Reserva Merlot (Central Valley)
"This is a very simple, friendly, fresh and lively white—easy to drink and enjoy with its lemony freshness. It's ideal for a party.",Famille Hauller 2015 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"This aromatic, medium-bodied white flirts with a distinct grassiness that can overwhelm, before settling into finer notions of grapefruit and stone fruit, as well as ripe, fleshy cantaloupe.",Black Stallion 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Chunky aromas of tomato, saucy berry fruits, asphalt and tire rubber are somewhat harsh. Flat and lazy in feel, this chunky, full-bodied number from Bío Bío tastes of baked cherry and plum fruit. A finish with low acidity and not much kick is the ending.",Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2013 Tectonia Pinot Noir (Bío Bío Valley)
"Lively, spicy oak aromas, rich fruit flavors and a lightly tannic texture make this a well-balanced dry wine that will be great with burgers, ribs or carne asada burritos. The price can't be beat either.",Bota Box 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Straightforward red-fruit aromas suggest cherry and plum. Rubbery, pinching tannins are the adhesive for this punchy young Rioja that tastes of raspberry and cherry and finishes steady.",Campellares 2014  Rioja
"Almost white in color, this wine is fruity and crisp with lemon and lime flavors. A light hint of a tannic structure also suggests minerality. The aftertaste is bright and packed with acidity.",Château Côte Montpezat 2015 Le Canon de Côte Montpezat Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"This pale-colored wine has a light, perfumed character. A blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, it is an attractive, bone-dry rosé, ripe with strawberry fruits, that will be best with food.",Château Léon 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"This opens with aromas that recall tropical fruit, hay and a whiff of chopped mint. The palate has weight and an almost oily texture but it lacks fruit richness, suggesting unripe pear, lemon zest and flint alongside brisk acidity.",Agricola Bellaria 2014 Oltre  (Greco di Tufo)
"Aromas of black plum, black cherry, green bramble and a touch of eucalyptus precede flavors of blackberry, raspberry and red plum.",Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Romania)
"Pineapple, citrus blossom, and white peach aromas prepare your palate for tastes of green apple, lemon zest and apricots. The finish is crisp and acidic.",Cramele Recas 2014 Legendary Estate Series Pinot Grigio (Romania)
Aromas of black berry and black cherry lead to flavors of cherry vanilla and red plum before a soft tannic finish.,Cramele Recas 2015 Dreambird Merlot (Romania)
Rich flavors like vanilla and fig combine with a creamy texture and sweet finish to make a cream puff of a wine. The texture is soft and acidity quite low.,Nica 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"The caramel character of this wine is less attractive than its background of red fruits. The two sides need to come into balance for it to work completely, so wait until late 2016.",Producta Vignobles 2015 Cabane aux Oiseaux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Reedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show. Grabby on the palate, this tastes of basic plum and raspberry. A raw, tannic, rubbery finish is the final act.",Rio Madre 2014  Rioja
"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch. Flavors of cantaloupe and citrus fruits finish yeasty, with notes of corn and white bread.",Rios de Chile 2015 Chardonnay (Central Valley)
"A very drinkable, light and easy to like Merlot, this offers ripe notes of black plum, cherry and berry on the nose and mouth, with a faint hint of milk chocolate in the background. The soft mouthfeel and fruity palate finish short, but clean.",Le Petit Cochonnet 2015 Merlot (Pays d'Oc)

"There are a lot of uncommon, unusual elements to this Pinot. For starters, the nose is volatile, with notes of horseradish and grapefruit. The palate has a solid, juicy feel to it, while mulchy cherry and plum flavors finish aimlessly.",Loma Larga 2013 Unfiltered Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"This wine smells fruity, like raspberry and cranberries, and turns very tart and astringent on the palate. Sharp fruit flavors come out on the finish along with a metallic edge.",Los Portales 2013 Garnacha (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"This is herbal and ripely fruited all at once, smelling like sweet pea, carnation and baby powder combined with tones of plum and cherry. The fruity notes continue through to the medium-weight palate, though they're short-lived.",Maison Nicolas 2015 Rosé (Gard)
"This light-bodied Rioja smells of cherry, plum and cotton candy. It's a bit thin on the palate but offers just enough body to be worthwhile. Mild plum and cherry flavors hollow out on the simple finish.",Montebuena 2014 Cuvée KPF  (Rioja)
"Forced, candied aromas of chocolaty oak and herbal, slightly weedy berry fruits feed into a chunky, blocky, creamy palate with saucy berry flavors combined with minty, top-heavy oak. The finish tastes minty, lactic and oaky, with heat.",Montes 2014 Classic Series Merlot (Colchagua Costa)
"Berry and cherry aromas register as soupy and flat. Like the nose, this feels flat, chewy and dense. Stewed, rubbery prunes and plums finish with a fig-like note and rubbery tannins.",Rayun 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"Flat, dusty aromas of lees and vanilla cookies are rather lifeless. While this is wet and somewhat juicy in feel, it's bland as a whole, with yeasty melon and citrus flavors that finish bready.",Rios de Chile 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Fermented entirely in stainless steel, this is a simple, tropically sweet wine, characterized by mango, pineapple and juicy melon.",River Road 2015 Un-Oaked Chardonnay (Sonoma County)

"This full-bodied wine has earthy, woodsy aromas, ripe and mature fruit flavors and a broad, almost soft texture. It's very mouth-filling and smooth, and will please people who like a little rusticity in their wines.",Housley's Century Oak 2013 Judy's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Aromas like jam and maple syrup and equally ripe, generous flavors give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. The texture is soft for this type, the flavors are not too deep and the finish is light.",Twisted 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Saucy aromas run low on fruit and high on tomato and green herbs. In the mouth, this feels rough. Flavors of bell pepper, pizza sauce and oregano finish without the ripeness that should be present in a high-end 2011 RDD.",Valtravieso 2011 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)
"This is a strawberry-pink-colored wine with candied flavors balanced by acidity. It is fruity, crisp and light in character.",Château Lamothe-Vincent 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"With only the lightest texture, this wine almost tastes like a white wine. It has plenty of citrus character, partnered with apple and green-fruit flavors. At the end, look out for the bite of tannin that gives it a more rosé character.",Château Laubès 2015 Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Rather vegetal aromas of jalapeño and bell pepper mix with red fruit on the nose of this bottling. Those same bell peppery notes carry through the palate, which is intriguing but will likely confuse many drinkers.",Four Sisters Ranch 2011 Serena's Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
This is a simple representation of the variety: medium in acidity and weight and a roundness of appropriate apple and pear that finishes flat.,Frei Brothers 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Woody, creamy aromas of black fruits precede a sketchy palate with acidity akin to vinegar. Medicinal flavors of oak, mint and generic berry fruits finish with a pasty feel and herbal, oaky flavors.",G7 2013 The 7th Generation Reserva Carmenère (Loncomilla Valley)
"Prickly, punchy, pryazinic aromas will have you thinking this is Sauvignon Blanc or Spanish Verdejo. A sharp palate is more about acid than body, while this continues with its SB-like character via green flavors of lime and arugula. A crisp finish evaporates into nothing.",Albamar 2015 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Heavy oak and marginal white-fruit scents make for a compromised nose. This feels chunky and resiny, with heavy flavors of clove and raw wood. Additional clove notes on the finish render this Chardonnay an underachiever.",Indomita 2015 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Dark-colored, full-bodied and practically sweet with oak, this box wine spreads spicy flavors around the fruit, and becomes more syrupy with each sip.",Loft 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Apple and honeydew aromas show on the nose of this boxed wine, which prides itself on having a small eco-footprint. The palate is flatter than the nose, with green apple skin flavors but not much texture or acidity to speak of.",Loft 2014 Chardonnay (Monterey)

"Barely noticeable aromas of wet rocks and sour red-fruit skins try to show on the nose of this wine. The palate is characterized by iron, wet rocks and dust flavors, without much fruit.",Jekel 2014 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"Rustic, gaseous aromas of soupy berry fruits and tire rubber create a struggling nose. Rubbery tannins and a lack of a focal point make for a jumbled palate, while this tastes stewy, weedy and low on fresh fruit.",Kunza 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)

"From Bacio Divino, this Sangiovese-based blend is curiously soft. While it has forward cherry, cocoa and spice flavors, it simply lacks structural integrity.The alcohol is evident on the warm, dry finish.",Pazzo 2009 Red (Napa Valley)
This is a fresh and fragrant rosé from the Vinho Verde region. It has light acidity and a red fruit flavor. The lightest prickle gives just that extra lift.,Quinta de Gomariz 2011 Espadeiro Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Simple and agreeable, this can be paired with a burger or beef taco. It's dry and clean, with pleasant cherry and cola flavors.",Sean Minor 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)

"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.",Valentin Bianchi 2011 Elsa Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Vanilla and toasted almond aromas evolve into a scent of tarte tatin. Full bodied, with warm alcohol, this shows medium fruit concentration. The acidity is borderline in its balance, leaning to flabiness. The tactile heat on the medium finish is distracting.",Vignobles Garrigae 2010 Seigneurie de Peyrat Tradition Chardonnay-Viognier (Pays d'Oc)

"Dark in color, intense in fruit flavor and firmly packed with tannins, this blockbuster Bordeaux-style blend feels massive and grippy.

Age a few bottles through 2019 to see how it matures.",Marietta Cellars NV Arme Lot Number 3 Red (North Coast)
"Slightly muted tones of black cherry and plum preserves are accented by wet soil, mushroom and coconut in this rustic yet elegant Cabernet Franc.

Straightforward and already approachable, it will offer enjoyable sipping in the near term. Drink through 2020.",Baccinetti 2011 Saporaia  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Quite light in the glass, the aromas on this bottling are also a bit weak, with cinnamon and red fruits emerging with patience. It's light and lithe on the palate, with candied cherry, rose petals and tons of cracked pepper making for a lengthy, grippy sip.",Rideau 2014 Estate Grenache
"This wine is made in a ripe forward style, with lightly volatile aromas of apple, plum and dark raspberries. It's full bodied and pulls no punches as generous red and black-fruit flavors with cocoa accents show some warmth on the finish.",Ryan Patrick 2013 Reserve Northridge Vineyard Grenache (Wahluke Slope)
"Roasted smoky berry aromas are good but nothing special. This feels alive and wiry, with grabby tannins and prodding acidity. Roasted spicy plum and berry flavors finish dry, spicy and in good shape.",San Pedro 2014 1865 Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)

"Flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent Tempranillo. The palate is big and chewy, with fine balance and driving flavors of cherry, plum, vanilla and oak resin.

"This is a very successful wine, made in the Paso style of soft voluptuousness and plenty of ripe, fruity flavors.

Should develop over the next six years.",RN Estate 2010 Harmonie des Cepages Red (Paso Robles)

Enjoyable now, after decanting, and should age through 2019.",RN Estate 2011 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"California Cabernet simply doesn't get richer or riper than this. It explodes with blackberry and cherry jam and chocolate flavors whose sweetness persists into the long, spicy finish. And yet the wine is technically dry. Drink over the next few years.",Écluse 2010 Lock Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Candied fruit, caramel, smooth vanilla cream and apricot open the opulent bouquet of this beautifully made Riserva Chardonnay. Elena Walch produces one of the best, oak-aged expressions of the grape in Italy. It closes with creamy richness and persistence.",Elena Walch 2009 Riserva Castel Ringberg Chardonnay (Alto Adige)
"While this is certainly herbaceous, it also carries richer fruit flavors like apricots and melon to go with the grapefruit acidity.

Will develop for many years, but there's no reason not to drink it now.",Chase 2009 Petite Sirah (Calistoga)

"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now.

Sattui 2009 Paradiso Red (Napa Valley)
"Give this brisk, young Pinot 5–6 years in the cellar to mellow. It's clearly a very fine wine, clean and elegantly constructed, with rich tannins and a bright squirt of acidity framing ripe cherry, currant and licorice flavors.",Westerly 2010 Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)

"This wine is frankly high in alcohol, clocking in at 16% by volume. But it's also incredibly delicious, offering soft waves of milk chocolate, black cherry jam, red currants, bacon and black pepper.

"This wine from Château Lagrézette is powerful and dense in its own right. It has black, juicy, tar-like flavors with tannins concentrated into a dry, dark core. Blended with a small proportion of Merlot, there is just a touch of softness which will allow the wine to mature in the next 2–3 years.",Château Lagrézette 2010 Château Chevaliers Lagrézette Malbec (Cahors)
"A dark, brooding wine, packed with firm tannins and solid plum-skin and licorice flavors.

"This edition of Dosaggio Zero shows delicate harmony and complexity with layers of stone fruit, citrus, almond and white flower. Zesty perlage is enhanced by more stone fruit flavors on the silky finish.",Contadi Castaldi 2008 Zero Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"The top wine from Domaine de Cause, it's huge, very dense and concentrated. There is a sense of extraction, showcased by the licorice and dark chocolate flavors. This needs to calm down to give the rich fruits a chance to shine. Give this wine 6–7 years.",Domaine de Cause 2009 Notre Dame de Champs Malbec (Cahors)
"Reduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.",Losada 2013 El Pájaro Rojo Mencía (Bierzo)
"In this case, Vieilles Vignes (old vines) only means vines over 20 years. The wine is soft, rounded and full of red cherry fruitiness. Judicious wood aging has rounded the wine out while leaving all its fruit intact. It can be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",Manuel Olivier 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Bourgogne Hautes Côtes de Nuits)
"Aromatically appealing, it features notes of allspice, herbs, cola and cherry. The palate is lighter in style with a scrape-y feel, not fully delivering on all that the aromas have to offer.",Windy Bay 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This light-colored wine has a spicy character that points up the tannins as well as the red berry fruits. It has a light feeling, with refreshing acidity that shows strongly at the end. It's ready to drink.",Vignerons de Buxy 2012 Buissonnier  (Mercurey)
"Aromas of tobacco leaf, wet soil, mature plum, resin and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The palate offers dried prune layered with notes of chocolate and grilled sage. The fleeting finish closes on a rather bitter note.",Villa Girardi 2010  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Yellow fruits and apple juice combine in this fresh, mineral-driven wine. It's tangy, tight with acidity while allowing room for pineapple and tropical flavors at the end.

"Wiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.",Pagos del Rey 2008 Arnegui Reserva  (Rioja)
"Made principally from Touriga Nacional, this is a rich wine with attractive acidity and strawberry fruitiness. It is ripe, touched with caramel and finished with wild raspberry flavors.",Quinta de Covela 2013 Covela Rosé (Minho)

"One of the lesser-known of the many Mâcon appellations, Péronne is close to Clessé. The wine is smooth, ripe and fruity, with a creamed pear and lightly lemon flavor. With a hint of minerality, it could age until 2016.",Jaffelin 2013 Les Villages de Jaffelin  (Mâcon-Péronne)
"From the recent appellation at the southern end of the Côte de Beaune, this is a light and very fruity wine with little discernible tannin or structure. Red cherries and fresh acidity dominate and the wine should be drunk young.",Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012 Clos des Rois Premier Cru  (Maranges)
"This starts out savory and smoky on the nose, but with airing it turns murky. The palate is tight in structure, with red-fruit acidity. Flavors of cherry, raspberry and oaky vanilla turn roasted and stalky as this unwinds on a fresh-feeling finish.",Lealtanza 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Dust and pollen notes linger from nose to finish on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Apple and pear flavors are a tad savory, but brightened by crisp lemon acidity. A refreshing and easy drinking wine.",Maximin Grünhäuser 2012 Herrenberg Alte Reben Trocken Riesling (Mosel)

"Soft and supple, this has a heavy streak of spearmint and an herbal finish that also offers dark black cherry and ripe, leathery tannins.",Ancient Oak Cellars 2011 Siebert Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Reduced, stewy, lightly herbal aromas blend berry and tomato scents. The acidity on this five-grape blend is pointed and overriding. Flavors of herbal berry and currant are tangy but also stewy, while the finish is long and green in flavor.",Cellers Baronia del Montsant 2010 Englora Red (Montsant)
"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now.",Benziger 2012 Appellation Series Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Soft and ripe, this has strawberry fruit flavors, a soft texture and a warm, rich feel. There is just enough acidity to balance this really food-friendly rosé.",Herdade do Rocim 2013 Olho de Mocho Rosé (Alentejano)
"Rustic aromas recall wet earth, barnyard and leather with a whiff of ripe, black fruit. The thick palate is rather muddled and delivers both sweet and bitter sensations of prune, overripe black plum, confectionary flavors, vanilla and notes of resin alongside astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.",Le Bertarole 2010 Podere Cariano  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"The pink hue is a little flat. That also applies to the palate, with the fruit showing some maturity and hinting at wood aging. It's a rounded style, full in the mouth, with ripe caramel flavors at the end. Drink now.",Poças NV Poças Pink  (Port)
"Light and bright, this has a crisp prickle on the tongue, along with canned grapefruit and tight apple-skin flavors. It is almost dry, which gives the wine a mineral texture that adds a bite. Drink now.",Quintas de Melgaço 2013 QM Blue White (Vinho Verde)
"A pretty, grapey wine with tones of pine and lemon underlying flavors of green plum and quince. It's flavorful, off-dry and refreshing; a good expression of Seyval Blanc.",Augusta Winery 2008 Seyval Blanc (Augusta)
"A little too dry and tannic, with earthy flavors of tobacco, sage, pepper and dried leather, which only partially relieve the modest blackberries and black currants. Way too astringent all the way through.",Bella 2007 Lily Hill Estate Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Dusty apple aromas are less citrusy than ideal, and the palate is cidery and tangy. Finishes with heft, length and weight, which all seems a little overbearing given the wine's simplicity. Just good enough but doesn't fully click.",Carmen 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)
"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.",Pulenta Estate 2008 La Flor Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"In a piece of French wine shorthand, the new appellation of Saint-Bris takes in the old Sauvignon de Saint-Bris wines. The style, though, hasn't changed: an attractive, if rustic type, with crisp gooseberry and grapefruit flavors and a fresh burst of acidity. Screwcap.",Simonnet-Febvre 2007 Sauvignon de Saint-Bris  (Saint-Bris)
"Dry and rough in texture, with berry, cherry, tobacco, herb and spice flavors wrapped into edgy, slightly green tannins. Turns sharp on the finish, and not likely to age.",Williamson Wines 2006 Clarissa Vin Rouge Red (Dry Creek Valley)
"Dry, with thick tannins housing blackberry, herb and olive flavors. Drink now.",Mendocino Farms 2005 Heart Arrow Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino)
"Charming and perfumed, with notes of musk, white flowers and wild grapes on the nose and exotic spices in the mouth. This is not a concentrated wine, but there's enough acidity here to balance the slight sweetness and to make it a refreshing apéritif. Drink up.",Messina Hof 2009 Muscat Canelli (Texas)
"Berry, pickle and bramble aromas are a little tough and crusted over, while the palate is snappy and fresh in feel, with flavors of herbal berry fruit and pepper. A mild hint of oak and resin dry up the finish.",Morandé 2008 Pionero Merlot (Rapel Valley)
"The nose is honest and bright but not terribly expressive, with just a few delicate raspberry and cherry tones. In the mouth, bing cherry and damp earth notes takes over and continue on the medium finish. Try with a veal chop. Drink up.",La Chiripada 2007 Artist Series 1 Dolcetto (New Mexico)

"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple.",Luigi Bosca 2009 Finca la Linda Chardonnay (Luján de Cuyo)
"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.",O. Fournier 2007 Urban Uco Tempranillo (Uco Valley)
"A luxurious mouthfeel and good concentration are this wine's chief attractions. Flavors are more earthy than fruity, with tones of compost and stewed prunes. Medium finish shows ripe but slightly drying tannins. Drink now.",Pahrump Valley Winery 2005 Nevada Ridge First Crush Zinfandel (Nevada)
"Slightly sweet, with a honeyed edge to the rich pear, apple, peach and tropical fruit flavors. Just-in-time acidity fortunately provides balance.",Sobon Estate 2008 Viognier (Amador County)
"Despite some black cherry richness, there's a green, minty, stalky note of unripeness in this blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre that limits its appeal. Decanting doesn't help and neither will aging.",Terre Rouge 2007 Tete-a-Tete Red (Sierra Foothills)
"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",Three Fox 2007 Il Volpe Sangiovese (Virginia)
"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",Castello di Borghese 2006 Founder's Field Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
"This is a simple, light take on Syrah, with a little bit of black pepper, a hint of underbrush, but none of the texture and detail of pricier Washington bottles. It's a light, pleasant red, fine for pizza night.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.",Doña Paula 2009 Los Cardos Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Acidity dominates this wine, giving it a tart, almost sour taste. Couple that with the sizable tannins, and you have an uncomfortable wine. Call it rustic, old world. The blackberry, currant, coffee and herb flavors are fine.",Easton 2007 Cooper Ranch Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",Gilbert Cellars 2007 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"Readily likeable, with a nose of summer fruit soup layered over notes of field greens. The texture is lazy, with moderate acidity and almost no tannin. Try with ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce. Drink now.",Glenora 2007 Mason Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"Confected but pleasant aromas of cotton candy and sour apple drops dominate the nose, while the palate unfolds nicely with layers of lemon and red apple. Soft and lush, it picks up an apricot accent on the medium finish. Try with Thai food. Drink now.",Glenora 2008 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalapeño and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.",Finca Sophenia 2009 Altosur Sauvignon Blanc (Tupungato)
"This vineyard has proven it can ripen good Malbec, but here it seems as if something has gone sideways. There is a gluey scent underneath the blackberry fruit, and the wine seems chalky and disjointed in the mouth, with more of the band-aid flavors in the finish.",Gilbert Cellars 2007 Estate Malbec (Wahluke Slope)
"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors. There's not a lot of bright fruit or nuance, but it will ably partner simple grilled meats.",Woolundry Rd 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"This is a pretty wine, and the initial flavors are soft and mature, suggesting a wine that's ready to drink now. In the mouth it falls away quickly with a slightly oxidized character that suggests an early fade is on the way. It's gentle and drinks well enough right now, with some barrel notes of caramel and coffee beefing up the finish.",Anam Cara 2005 Nicholas Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"An exotic bouquet suggests dried roses, brown sugar, cranberry and plum jam. There's a sweetness in the mouth that continues the impression of brown sugar, or maybe a streak of cola. It's an interesting bottle that could develop further or fall off a cliff; it turns a little funky in the finish. More than 12,000 cases were made.",Archery Summit 2004 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"A solid entry into the everyday Cabernet sweepstakes. Shows ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis and spice flavors in a smooth, polished texture whose tannins cry out for steaks and chops.",Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)

"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.",Doña Paula 2006 Los Cardos Syrah (Luján de Cuyo)
"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",Kenwood 2004 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County)
"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.",Leeuwin Estate 2003 Prelude Vineyards Cabernet Merlot (Margaret River)
"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",Parkers Estate 2005 Riverside Crossing Syrah (Sonoma County)
"This is a perfectly fine example of Clare Valley Cabernet, one that emphasizes refinement and elegance over sheer power and intensity. Cassis, tobacco and a hint of vanilla account for the bulk of the aromatic and flavor interest, and it turns mouthwatering on the finish. Should hold well through 2015.",Pearson Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)
"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",Simonnet-Febvre 2006  Chablis
"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Campos Góticos 2003 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",Frostwatch 2005 Chardonnay (Bennett Valley)
"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Vinos Sanz 2006 Montesol Verdejo (Rueda)
"This is a blend of Inzolia and Sauvignon from a producer located high up the steep mountains above Cefalù on Sicily's western flank with cool nighttime temperature and soothing breezes. Straightforward aromas include green herb, white stone and citrus.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Sinestesìa White (Sicilia)
"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.",Pascual Toso 2007 Maipu Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Shows some slightly green tomato-leaf and bell-pepper notes as well as hints of leather and hung game, but despite all that, there's also ripe cassis and chocolate flavors and a supple mouthfeel. Imported by MHW,Ltd.",Red Mud 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"From one of Sicily's most beautiful and promising vineyards, Baccante is a blend of Grillo and Chardonnay with bright clean acidity and fragrant yellow fruit. The only setback here is a matchstick aroma (not present in past years) that prevents this vintage from scoring higher.",Abbazia Santa Anastasia 2006 Baccante White (Sicilia)
"A light entry holds flavors of strawberry and tomato leaf, then turns tannic. Chewy and earthy, with more than a hint of seed and stem, this wine comes from biodynamically farmed grapes that add some earthy nuances, but put too much emphasis on green tea, stemmy flavors.",Archery Summit 2004 Renegade Ridge Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Earthy, soft and dry, this Zin has tobacco, cherry, blackberry and spice flavors, with an edge of sweet leather and pine. It's a refreshingly simple country-style Zin that will be nice with barbecue.",Castoro Cellars 2005 Cobble Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",French Hill 2005 Grand Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills)
"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",Vitis Terrarum 2003 Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Seems rather oak-dominated, boasting ample brown sugar, vanilla and dill scents backed my some briary, blackberry fruit. Fills out a bit with air, so decant an hour or so prior to serving. Drink now.",Vasse River 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Margaret River)
"Like a trip through an orchard, this Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre blend bursts with flavors of cherries, raspberries, blackberries, tangerines, kumquats, dates, golden mangoes, yellow currants, the list goes on and on. It's a little on the sweet side, while grippy tannins give the palate handrails to negotiate this fruity ride.",Kaleidos 2004 Morpheus Red (Paso Robles)
"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",Lovingston 2005 Josie's Knoll Merlot (Monticello)

"Owner Thierry Valette has been around the Right Bank (the family owned Pavie and owns Troplong Mondot) and, as a consultant, the world. Here he offers a delicious juicy wine with fine tannins and ripe red fruits. It has mint and spice perfumes along with balanced acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",Clos Puy Arnaud 2014  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux
"This Alliance Bourg co-op wine is packed with minty new-wood aromas, this has the potential to be a smooth, polished wine. The blend is 70% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. Firm tannins at this stage do not mask the ripe blackberry fruits. Give this wine until 2019 before drinking.",Closerie du Bailli 2014 Grande Réserve  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Intense notes of ripe red and baked apples make a strong impression. The palate is rich with the same baked apple along with a touch of honey and gingerbread. The yeasty flavors of autolysis provide an ideal backdrop for this structured, grown-up and classy wine. The finish is totally dry and wonderfully long.",Domaine François Schmitt NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background.",Penley Estate 2012 Special Select Shiraz (Coonawarra)

"This big, dramatic wine has a dark color and bold aromas of wood smoke and black pepper. Flavors are concentrated but also dry and appetizing. Firm tannins add grip and seem to help the peppery, smoky accents linger on the finish. Best after 2020.",Obsidian Ridge 2012 Half Mile 2640' Red (Red Hills Lake County)
"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence.",Opolo 2014 Summit Creek Zinfandel (Paso Robles)

"Superbly warm weather in 2015 gave an extra boost of sunshine to many of the Mosel's entry-level wines, and the RK is one of the best. Whiffs of freesia and tangerine peel waft from the glasss of this semidry Riesling. It's low in alcohol, yet so honeyed and ripe that flavors of grapefruit and peach seem to slick sumptuously on the palate. Zesty lime acidity freshens a lingering finish.",Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2015 RK Riesling (Mosel)
"This sensational effort was fermented and briefly aged in neutral oak. The striking package sets it apart from all other Rex Hill wines, and the rich, complex flavors add to the impression that this is something truly special.

"This rich, rewarding wine pleases in baked blueberry pie and a taste of raisin cake, its texture underlined in soft, integrated oak and a velvety density. Cinnamon, black pepper and toffee weave within the waves of ripeness.",Robert Biale 2014 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"The vineyard source for this tasty wine is farmed by a fifth-generation Japanese-American originally from California's Central Valley. Tightly wound in oak and tannin, it opens pleasantly to reveal a wealth of rose petals, earth and youthful ripe, dark cherry. With moderate acidity and body, it lingers on the palate.",Spell 2014 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"The nose is uncertain and hovers between musky botrytis and lactic tartness. The palate removes all doubt and shines with luscious, concentrated sweetness, referencing the pleasant bitterness of honeycomb and the spice of maple syrup. Pure lemon freshness illuminates everything. Drink now through 2025.",Gruber Röschitz 2015 Trockenbeerenauslese Chardonnay (Niederösterreich)

"Deep and lush aromas of candied blueberry and black cherry meet with chocolate cake, light brown spices and a touch of beef jerky on the nose of this judiciously priced wine. Though a tad light on the palate at first, it has an energetic and spicy acidity that carries forth flavors of tobacco and black fruit.",Joseph Carr 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Enticingly fragrant, this offers alluring scents of rose, perfumed berry, chopped mint, menthol and cake spice. The elegant palate delivers tart red cherry, aromatic herb and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins and bright acidity. A mineral note signals the close. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2032.",La Prevostura 2012  Lessona
"Although this is a nonvintage wine, it is a blend around 2012, hence the number in the name. Dominated by Pinot Noir, this ripe, full-bodied wine has a tangy texture boosted by acidity that contrasts with rich red apple and crisp pear flavors that give richness. Drink now.",Lallier NV R.012 Brut  (Champagne)

"Notes of ripe yellow apple play enticingly on the nose.

The bubbles are creamy and disperse the lovely flavors to great effect. This is classy and delicious.",Domaine Zinck NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)

A mineral note wraps around the crisp finish.",Dubl NV Rosé Brut Metodo Classico Aglianico (Vino Spumante)
"This version of old-vines Carignan-Garnacha is heavily toasted to the point of smelling charred, with coffee and cured-beef notes.

Licorice notes and a final blast of char control the finish. Drink through 2021.",Ferrer Bobet 2012 Vieilles Velles Red (Priorat)

Drink through 2022.",Vallana 2007  Boca
"This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.",Krupp Brothers 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Synchrony Red (Napa Valley)
"Pamplin's admirable focus on its pair of Bordeaux-style blends is rather rare. This is the more expensive of the two, and a fine, fat, forward bottling in this warm vintage. It's three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, with lovely fruit that's compact upon opening, fleshing out with air time. Clean, dense and focused, it is bright with berry and cassis flavors, plus subtle barrel notes.",Pamplin 2009 Proprietary Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

Drink this beauty over the next six years.",Sterling 2009 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a lush and satisfying Rivesaltes Ambré, made from 100% White Grenache and aged in oak for seven years. There's a gorgeous rancio quality to the wine with notes of almond and orange rind throughout, framed by aromas and flavors of quince paste, wood-grilled peach, fruit cake and carmelized date. The long finish shows good evolution, transitioning from notes of stone fruit to peach pit and finally ending on a sweet spice accent.",Domaine Cazes 1996 Ambré Grenache Blanc (Rivesaltes)

"Deeply layered and pure on the nose, with tar, cola and toasty oak aromas, this feels deep, full and choppy, with tough tannins and seriously dark flavors of blackened spice, berry and bitter chocolate.

"This is a powerful, wood-aged wine. It's still showing its toast at the moment, but expect the wine to round out, yielding solid tannins and a concentrated black-plum flavor. With a rich yet firm finish, this should age well over several years.",Scheiblhofer 2010 Andau Zweigelt (Burgenland)
"This Merlot-dominated blend features juicy berry flavors and tart, citrusy acids. It has gentle details of pepper, herb, lemon verbena and orange peel. It's a pleasure to see more elegant complexity in these latest Spring Valley reds.",Spring Valley Vineyard 2009 Uriah Estate Grown Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This ripe, full, almost toasty wine tastes of tropical fruit and spice, giving it an exotic feel. At the same time, the right amount of acidity acts as a fine balance. This concentrated wine, medium-sweet in style, should be aged for 2–3 years.",Jean-Marc Bernhard 2010 Furstentum Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)

"Styled after the great white wines of Bordeaux, this is fresh and clean, with luscious mixed fruit flavors that emphasize apple and melon.

Given its impeccable balance, it could be cellared for another 6–8 years.",DeLille 2011 Chaleur Estate Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A blend of 58% Syrah, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Mourvèdre, this combinins power with a big yum factor. Potent and rich, with woody, spicy highlights, the juicy fruit flavors favor blackberry and black cherry. A whiff of smoke runs through the finish.",Doyenne 2009 Aix Red (Red Mountain)
"The chalk soil of the Rabenstein Vineyard has 50-year-old vines, which produce a dense, concentrated wine. Spice and mineral characters combine with creamed apple in a rich display.

"Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins.

"Cola, coconut and ripe blackberry aromas are draped all over the wine's bouquet. On the palate, it's a bit choppy and acidic, with pounding flavors of black cherry, blackberry and leather.

"This is so chocolaty and rich, it's impossible to resist a second or third glass. Although it's heady in alcohol, there's an excellent burst of acidity, and the texture is pure velvet. The blackberry tart, orange zest, spice and sandalwood flavors change continuously as the wine warms in the glass.",Turley 2010 Library Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"This is classically proportioned in the warm-climate style. It provides a textbook example of the variety's inky black and purple color, rich, thick tannins and elaborate flavors.

Full-bodied and dry, this is a wine to warm the blood on cold winter nights.",Turley 2010 Pesenti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Very opulent and jammy in blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this has a strong oak presence in the form of caramelized wood.

"A stellar, superb wine that embodies all the grace, power and charm of the Mount Etna volcano in Sicily. This highly unique and distinctive territory has shaped an elegant expression of Nerello Mascalese (with 20% Nerello Cappuccio) offering aromas of wild berry set against delicately toasted pistachio nut. In the mouth, the wine is silky, compact and very persistent.",Benanti 2006 Serra della Contessa Red (Sicilia)
"Another stellar effort from this terrific new winery. Luscious aromas—stone fruits, candy, wax, peel, honey, cumin, allspice—it just keeps on going. Firm in the mouth, with the same exotic and refined blend of interesting spices and fruits. A tour de force.",Maison Bleue 2009 Soleil Roussanne (Yakima Valley)
"Awesome. A superior California Syrah, one of the finest of the vintage. Although it's dry, it's massive in blackberry and blueberry pie filling fruit, with interesting complexities of smoked meats, black pepper, minerals from the earth, cola and sandalwood. Just delicious now, and should hold in the bottle over the next six years.",Pax 2007 Kobler Family Vineyard Syrah (Green Valley)
"Big, full-bodied wine, the great tannins dominating the underlying red fruit. It's firmly concentrated, intense, a powerhouse of dense texture and obviously a wine that will need aging. Give it 5–6 years.",Chanson Père et Fils 2008  Charmes-Chambertin
"Very dense wine, its tannins solid and concentrated. The structure is the leader here, with the young fruit showing through as black plum skins and crushed strawberries. This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.",Chanson Père et Fils 2008  Clos de Vougeot
"A super-structured, incredibly textured Syrah from the Sierra Foothills, this is Bill Easton's best of the best lots, aptly named Ascent, that he puts out every year to showcase his deft handling of age-worthy Syrah. This one will continue to develop its earthy, dusty, bacon fat and cigar box qualities over time. A truly beautiful bottle of wine.",Domaine de la Terre Rouge 2008 Ascent Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.",Domaine Leflaive 2008 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine. For aging at least six years.",Joseph Drouhin 2008 Clos des Mouches Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Lots of toasty oak on this Pinot, but also plenty of rich, unctuous fruit to support it. Shows ample flavors of cloves, cinnamon, ripe wild cherries, and earthy, forest floor notes of balsam and dried pine needles. The texture is lightly delicate and silky, with crisp acidity. Really shows off the Clos Pepe terroir in a delightful way.",Tyler 2008 Clos Pepe Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.",Trefethen 2007 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
"This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring. Almost sweetly jammy in black cherries, raspberries, cola and caramelized oak, it's rescued by firm tannins and a finish that dries it out in minerals and spices. Now–2016.",Trefethen 2008 Dragon's Tooth Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
"Supple, dark, and laced with licorice, cassis, and clove, this well-crafted Bordeaux blend does not scream high alcohol, though it tops 14.6%. What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit.",Alexandria Nicole 2008 Destiny Ridge Vineyard Destiny Red Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",Lineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley)
"Wide open and seductive, this brings together grapes from both Conner Lee (northern Columbia Basin) and Champoux (Horse Heaven Hills). Muscular, ripe and round, the sweet blackberry and cassis fruit is limned with a granite-like minerality. Great concentration and layering—a berry/rock/tannin layer cake.",Buty 2009 Merlot-Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This particular bottling belongs with the very best Syrahs from this Syrah-infatuated state. A broad, toasty, full-bodied and fully realized wine, it has begun to smooth out from the extra years in bottle, but has a long life ahead. Berries, cherries, chocolate, coffee, mocha, tobacco, fungus, graphite… the flavors go and go.",McCrea 2006 Boushey Grande Côte Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%). Hints of roasted or grilled meat and black olive balance the bold blackberry fruit, leaving behind a lingering finish of warmth and dusty cocoa. Drink now–2020.",Torbreck 2007 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)
"As always, Beringer's Alluvium blend is a complex white wine, meant to pair with good food. The '08 is comprised of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon, Chardonnay and Viognier. It's fruity, crisp and dry.",Beringer 2008 Alluvium Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Knights Valley)
Campo Magri is a bright and lively Valpolicella Superiore with crisp tones of cherry and wild berry backed by slight smoke and spice. The natural acidity will cut through the density or ossobuco or beef stew.,Corte Sant' Alda 2007 Campi Magri  (Valpolicella Superiore)
"This vineyard-designate Ripasso opens with dark concentration and lush aromas of mature fruit, spice, leather, chocolate and dried beef or cured ham. This is a rich and velvety wine that could stand up to barbecued short ribs smothered in spicy sauce.",Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Fabiano's newest Ripasso opens with bright cherry aromas followed by spice, clove, black pepper and pressed rose petal. The wine boasts a soft, steady feel in the mouth and relatively smooth texture overall.",Fabiano 2008  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"Instead of brawn and muscle, this ruby Ripasso offers elegance and finesse. The nose is redolent of polished black stone, Indian spice and loads of dried cassis and wild berry. There's a playful hint of sweet almond and cinnamon at the end.",Gamba 2007 Le Quare  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Another fine effort in a continuing series of outstanding PGs from Hogue. This is tart and stylish, loaded with citrus and bracingly acidic. Flavors meld lemon, lime, lemon verbena, orange peel and a slice of pear.",Hogue 2009 Pinot Grigio (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant.",Bell 2007 Claret Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
Ripasso Il Vegro offers a rich and meaty bouquet with aromas of cured beef and honey roasted ham. There are also bright fruit tones of cherry and blackberry and the wine adds a crisp touch of sour cranberry at the very end.,Brigaldara 2007 Il Vegro  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance.",Cadence 2008 Coda Red (Red Mountain)
"Campo Leòn is a jammy, chewy wine with raw notes of black cherry, Indian spice, cedar wood and melted chocolate. It's thick, syrupy and it's hard to imagine a balanced food pairing outside succulent red meat.",Latium di Morini 2005 Campo Leòn  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"This is a smooth and rich Amarone with equal parts jammy fruit set against a smokey oak component. The wine slides nicely over the palate with a lavish, velvety texture and imparts more oak spice and mesquite on the close.",Luigi Righetti 2006 Capitel de' Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A lively, balanced wine at an accessible price point, Marquee's 2008 Signature Chard boasts aromas of smoke, vanilla and stone fruit and flavors that follow along similar lines, with white peach and pineapple coming to the fore. Drink now–2012.",Marquee 2008 Signature Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
"A bit mulchy and swampy for Manso, with earthy tobacco and generic berry fruit aromas. The palate is flush and a little heavy, with creamy flavors of vanilla, dill weed and cassis. Soft and sweet late, with chunkiness and a medium to basic structure. A very good wine but not great as in past years.",Miguel Torres 2007 Manso de Velasco Viejas Viñas Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"Classic, soft, easy and broad Pinot Blanc. There is an attractive buttery character to go with the peach and lime flavors. The wine is ripe, with pure fruit and a final tang of acidity.",Mittnacht Frères 2009 Terre d'Etoiles Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"This is a powerful but not exaggerated style of Amarone that delivers ripe cherry and blackberry aromas followed by new leather, cigar box, spice and rum cake. It imparts a very smooth, rich and supple feel.",Monte del Frá 2005 Tenuta Lena di Mezzo  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A 70-30 blend of Corvina and Rondinella, this bright Amarone offers simple but genuine aromas of forest berry, toasted almond, cherry cola and vanilla bean. The wine is smooth, polished and crisp on the close.",Montresor 2006 Giacomo Montresor  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"This Riserva Amarone shows a meaty, bold, sweet and jammy personality with loads of aromatic intensity. It's almost too much of a good thing with overripe flavors of prune and berry marmalade.",Musella 2005 Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"The best Paso a Paso white yet; it's ripe and smells of pineapple and melon, while the palate is pure and has a solid feel. Flavors of apple, peach and pithy citrus are honest, and the finish is clean. Delivers what it should and more.",Paso a Paso 2009 Verdejo (La Mancha)
"From a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so.",Penfolds 2007 Bin 128 Shiraz (Coonawarra)
"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now.",Qupé 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",Ridge 2007 California Monte Bello Red (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Smoky, rubbery and sweet on the nose, with mocha and caramel shadings. The palate, however, is more tight and narrow; the feel is fresh and blazing, while the flavors are piercing and suggest red fruits like cranberry and cherry. Citric but with just enough weight to register as true Cabernet (with 18% Carmenère and 7% Cab Franc).",Santa Ema 2007 Catalina Red (Peumo)
"Bold and spicy, with a lot of cinnamon, licorice and toasty aromas. Quite intense in the mouth, where black cherry, toast and vanilla flavors lead the charge. The finish is tangy and long, with coffee and citrus accents coming along late in the game. Made from whole berries fermented in open-top vats.",Cono Sur 2008 20 Barrels Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"An interesting and unsual wine for Chile. Hailing from grafted vines originally planted to Chenin Blanc in 1956, this Viognier is superfloral, with oily aromas along with apple blossom, nectarine and apricot. The palate has nice natural acidity and sweet flavors of melon, mango and citrus. A little big and unfocused and sweet, but still intriguing and nicely made.",Cono Sur 2009 Visión Viognier (Colchagua Valley)
"Corte San Benedetto is a small, family run winery and its 2003 Amarone shows ripe notes of black cherry, mesquite, blackberry and soft vanilla. The oak element is evident here; the wine is soft and supple on the close.",Corte San Benedetto 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Loads of aromatic intensity comes through on the bouquet with lovely layers of ripe cherry, spice, mesquite wood, Indian spice and cola. The oak element is evident here and will integrate with a bit more time in the bottle. In the mouth, this rich, ruby-colored wine offers jammy fruit and soft, velvety texture.",Domìni Veneti 2006 Verjago  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"A mature, serious wine, showing toasty flavors that are rounding out the fruit. A definite food wine, its richness tempered with a bite of acidity and delicious final crispness.",Dopff & Irion NV Cuvée Prestige Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Here's a new producer from Valpolicella who presents a sharp and angular Amarone with fine aromas of spice, wild berry, black tobacco and tea leaf. The wine is bright and compact with soft tannins and natural freshness.",Falezza 2005  Amarone della Valpolicella
"Rich and spicy, this is a fine, dry, peppery Pinot Gris. In the mouth there's weight and ripeness, as well as some fat, yellow fruits. There's a touch of lychee as well, giving an exotic edge to the finish.",Rieflé 2006 Pinot Gris Bonheur Convivial Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A lot of olive and herbs upfront, with cumin and other exotic, arguably unusual aromas. The palate is soft and a little low on structure, but the flavors are big and sweet, almost overripe and syrupy. There's cola, blackberry, coffee and mulchy herbal flavors from start to finish. A big wine that needs to be drunk now; it's not going to get better.",Casa Silva 2005 Microterroir de los Lingues Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"With light toast aromas, this is a wine that shows vanilla from wood aging more than its fruitiness. There is a barnyard edge to it that brings out rusticity. On the finish, acidity does bring some freshness.",Château Lamothe-Vincent 2011 Le Grand Rossignol du Château Lamothe Vincent  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"Structure keeps this firm, dry wine solidly closed. It is tightly wound at this stage, only hinting at a brighter, fruity future. Drink after 2015.",Château Pey la Tour 2011  Bordeaux
"Sweet oak and rich cherry jam combine to make this blend distinctly candied in nature. It's a straightforward, simple with smooth tannins.",Clayhouse 2011 Red Cedar Vineyard Estate Syrah-Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in. There are pleasant cherry and blackberry flavors on the palate, but also a mushroomy streak that distracts. It's not likely to improve with age so drink up.",Dilecta 2011 The Tiller Caliza Vineyard Russell Family Vineyards Grenache-Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Harsh in mouthfeel, this Cab has cherry, black currant and wintergreen mint flavors, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. For the price, it's not bad for everyday fare.",Grayson 2012 Lot 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"This is a candied Pinot with flavors of pink bubblegum, raspberries and strawberries. Give it some time in the glass and drink up.",Vinemark 2011 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"The fruit flavors never get past light, tart cranberry in this wine, and there is an earthy tinge that runs through the palate and into the finish. It's thin and tannic in style.",Wetzel Estate 2010 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This rustic Cabernet has pretty good varietal flavors of blackberries and dried currants, enhanced with an oaky sweetness. It's full bodied and tannic, and fine for drinking now.",Magnolia Court 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)
"This value Pinot Noir is perfectly fine for everyday drinking, with a light, silky texture framing raspberry and oak flavors.",Picket Fence 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Recuerdo is the house brand from the Vines of Mendoza project, which is relying on young Tupungato vineyards that expand annually. This vintage shows floral berry aromas along with Middle East spice notes of cumin and curry. In the mouth, it's sharp and hollow, like an elevator that skips floors. Clipped flavors of boysenberry are acidic, while the finish lacks substance.",Recuerdo 2011 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Made with Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Barbera, Merlot and Cabernet, this wine opens with dominant oak aromas that carry through to the palate alongside subdued notes of prune and fig. It lacks fruit richness and freshness to support the oak.",Adanti 2009  Montefalco Rosso
"This wine has a lean side that takes away from the bright acidity and fruitiness. With its berry fruit flavors, it should be rich, but lacks a middle.",Château Haut Nadeau 2011 Réserve du Propriétaire  (Bordeaux Supérieur)

"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.",Salentein 2005 Reserve Malbec (Uco Valley)

"Fresh but rich, this young wine has structured edges, great purity of green currant fruits as well as fine concentration. The roundness of the palate is matched by its delicious acidity. Glass stopper.",Summerer 2007 Steinhaus Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"The flavors of this Pinot, made from pre-Dijon clone Martini selection vines, are fine. They range from cherries and cola to sweet cured tobacco and buttered cinnamon toast to smoky vanilla. If the wine had a crisper, livelier mouthfeel, it would score a lot higher.",Robert Stemmler 2005 Ferguson Block Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This is spicy and varietally specific, with sharp, tight, bright red berry flavors and a peppery finish.

"Coeur d'Alene Cellars does a fine job with Syrah. This has much the same satiny, sexy black fruit as the more expensive Opulence bottling, but it is more accessible and forward, with less power in the back end. Still, it's quite delicious, and the smoky tannins add some extra authority.",Coeur d'Alene 2005 Switchback Red Red (Washington)
"Typical Beaune in its round, soft character. If the tannins are not particularly powerful, it still shows a generous nature, with super-ripe fruits supported by some dryness. The finish is jammy, ripe, a salad of red berries.",Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005 Les Marconnets Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"A dark and richly spicy wine, with penetrating varietal scents of pepper and berry. The wine is tart and youthful, and along with the tangy flavors of berry and spice there is a layer of graphite and a hint of cured meat reaching into the finish.

"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.",Helix by Reininger 2005 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tomero is a new line from the Carlos Pulenta group, and this one sings the tale of Salta with sincerity. You get telling acacia and lychee aromas, but none of the cheap perfume that can sometimes ruin the variety. The palate is lightly oily but linear, while the papaya, citrus and melon flavors just roll along.",Tomero 2007 Torrontés (Salta)
"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish.

"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol. The Malbec is plenty ripe without being over-ripe, and the fruit retains a certain muscularity, along with a mélange of cherries, plums, rum-soaked raisins and coffee liqueur. Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Malbec (Wahluke Slope)
"Torres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather.

"Solid on the bouquet, this has notes of dark fruit and smoke, with an almond-like sweetness. Big, bulky and bullish in the mouth, it has roasted, meaty flavors that include campfire smoke, flamed meat and black fruit. The finish tastes charred but feels healthy and lively.",Andeluna 2010 Malbec (Mendoza)

"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up over 70% of this blend with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec.

The berry-led palate is rustic and unrefined, with feral flavors, peppery spice and decent acidity.",Now Presenting... 2014 Red (Paso Robles)
"Full bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.",On Point 2014 Christina's Cuvée Pinot Noir (North Coast)
Ripe perfumed black fruits dominate this cru wine. They float above the firm tannins and concentrated acidity to offer a wine that will become rich and generous as it develops. A touch of pepper and spice adds to the layers of fruit. Drink from 2018,Pardon et Fils 2015 Les Mouilles  (Juliénas)
"Spice and green pepper notes accentuate ripe luscious blackberry and cassis flavors in this classically inspired Cabernet Franc. Fine tannins and fresh cutting acidity lend vibe to the midpalate. Fleshy and ripe yet pleasantly herbaceous, it's ready to drink now but should hold well through 2022.",Paumanok 2014 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"This wine seems broad across the palate, but not quite as deep as some Condrieus. The fruit is understated, resembling gently toasted marshmallow and maybe a touch of baked pineapple, rather than flamboyant apricot and spice. Plan on serving it with fish or chicken rather than something rich or extravagant.",Jean-Luc Colombo 2013 Amour de Dieu  (Condrieu)
"This wine is big in tannin, extracted and full bodied, with dense blueberry and maple syrup at its core. For fans of a rich style, it will impress for  its ripe, dark fruit and sizable yet velvety mouthfeel.",Acacia 2013 Thornton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Cinsault would be a crowd favorite if more than 700 cases were available in the U.S. The black cherry fruit is punched up by hints of herbs and cracked pepper, there's ample weight but great freshness and zest, and the finish is long and complex, showing off hints of licorice, pepper and dusty earth. Drink now–2020.",Alain Jaume et Fils 2014 Haut de Brun Red (Côtes du Rhône)

"The dark red fruit is enveloped in the rounded, rich and chocolaty scent of oak. The palate shows a lighter side with delicate fruit of a red-cherry nature. Freshness sumptuous oak and red-cherry notes marry well. This is lovely now, but just a few more months in bottle will allow it to knit together more. Drink now through 2020.",Stift Klosterneuburg 2014 Ausstich St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.,Terroirs et Talents 2015 Clos de la Brosse  (Saint-Amour)
"Cassis, bell pepper, toast, French oak and coconut lead the nose. The aromas carry over to the tightly wound palate along with raw red currant, powdered sage, licorice and a confectionery note. Close-grained tannins leave a rather astringent finish.",Tua Rita 2013 Redigaffi Merlot (Toscana)

"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee. A peppery tasting finish with residual green flavors and mocha works for this decidedly herbal-leaning but high-quality wine. Drink now.",Bodegas Valdemar 2005 Inspiración  (Rioja)
"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness.

"This straightforward, perfectly clean blend of Carignan, Syrah and Garnacha would function as a great everyday house red.

"With damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth.

Drink now.",Real Sitio de Ventosilla 2004 RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma  (Ribera del Duero)
"Masses of sweet blackberry jam give this Cabernet an easy deliciousness. The fruit and oak are balanced with fine tannins and a gentle scour of acidity. Not one for the cellar, but it will benefit from an hour or two in the decanter.",Stryker Sonoma 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)

"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2011 Estate Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"This Rhône-style blend is fruity and delicious. It has raspberry, cherry, licorice, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into easy tannins, brightened with a bite of lime acidity. Ready to enjoy now.",The Farm Winery 2009 Touchy-Feely G-S-M (Paso Robles)

"Shows the dark color, thick tannins and deep, concentrated flavors you expect from Petite Sirah. It's a big gulp of blackberry jam, espresso, dark chocolate and crushed black pepper, and the finish is thoroughly dry. Lacks the acidic vibrancy needed for aging, but a fine wine to drink now.",Trueheart 2010 Truehart Vineyard Petite Sirah (Sonoma Valley)
"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",Val do Sosego 2011 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"A blend of grapes from several vineyards, this is named for a famous jazz tune. The blending both softens and expands the mid-palate, and seems to have boosted the aging curve.

"Rotgipfler is almost an exclusivity to Thermenregion. This bright, fruity wine is deliciously crisp with spice, pepper and pear flavors. It has a light lemon edge brought out by the refreshing acidity. Screwcap.",Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",Lynmar 2011 Monastery Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The nose sends up signals of a balanced, easygoing wine with oak blended nicely into pear and apple fruit. The palate is lively and mildly oaky, with baked apple, orange and woodspice flavors. A snappy, oaky finish with intense acidity closes the show.",Matetic 2011 EQ Chardonnay (San Antonio)
"The nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.",Oliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empordà)

"This wine doesn't seem to have fully ripened, with green, reedy aromas along with notes of cranberry and cherry Jolly Rancher. The full-bodied palate delivers more but seems disconnected with tart, tangy cranberry flavors.",Cana's Feast 2013 Northridge Vineyard Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of toast, oak, espresso and a whiff of smoke lead the nose. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, coffee and vanilla but there's not enough fruit richness to support the oak. It's already reached its ideal drinking window so enjoy sooner rather than later.",Cantine Leonardo Da Vinci 2010 Da Vinci Riserva  (Chianti)
"A stamp of smoke and toasted oak mark the entry into this wine, followed by chewy tannins that wrap themselves around dark layers of chocolate and tobacco leaf, the structure at first impenetrable. The finish is relaxed and somewhat short.",Hill Family Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"This tradition-bucking blend of 61% Chenin Blanc, 31% Viognier and 8% Roussanne offers soft aromas of sweet apple blossoms and peach, with a hint of barrel smoke. The palate offers a similar blend of peaches, pears and apples, warmed up with some oak influence.",Vinum 2013 White Elephant White (California)

"A strong oak influence dampens the varietal character in this full-bodied, spicy wine. It smells like cinnamon and cedar, tastes slightly sweet and smoky, is full bodied and rich in texture. Nice and smooth, it shows only mild varietal character.",Wise Villa 2013 Estate Grown Sangiovese (Placer County)
"This is a substantial wine, concentrated in dark red berry color and flavor, from cherry to wild strawberry to more savory rhubarb compote. Muted on the nose, it has an underlying woody, herbal character that balances the vibrancy of the fruit.",MacPhail 2014 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"If only this wine wasn't extracted so much (which gives bitterness), it would be ripe and fruity. As it is, it's hard to get past the tight, dry tannins. There are hints of juiciness and black currant fruits. It might soften by 2016.",Maison Bouey 2012 Château Lestruelle  (Médoc)

There is plenty of weight, the acidity coming from minerality and wood.",Clos de Gamot 2002 Cuvée des Vignes Centenaires Malbec (Cahors)
"Not many wines come from Bucelas today, as its vineyards get eaten up by the northern Lisbon suburbs.

"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as “oaky.”",Melipal 2006 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",Morrison Lane 2005 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Picked late and fermented on native yeast, this Viognier brings some snap and spice to its scents and flavors. The lime and quinine quality recalls a good gin and tonic; it definitely leans to the herbal rather than the tropical side of Viognier, but is crisp and refreshing.",Morrison Lane 2006 Viognier (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Fazio makes the best of hot climate growing conditions and presents a well-composed Nero d'Avola that is enhanced by aromas of red apple, cassis, pomegranate and black cherry. There's good intensity here and some sweetness, although the mouthfeel is in no way heavy or thick.",Fazio 2005 Torre dei Venti Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.",Gemtree 2006 Uncut Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"This is 100% Syrah from an excellent vineyard. It's chewy and even a bit salty in the mouth, with a mix of bell pepper and black pepper over streaks of berry and cassis. Most of the flavor is front-loaded, and the wine fades away into an earthy, fairly tannic finish.",Adamant Cellars 2006 Spofford Station Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The bouquet here is very floral and intense: you'll get jasmine, honeysuckle, sweet apple, mango and other exotic fruits. The wine tastes clean, sweet and dense and has fragrant flavors that accompany you glass after glass.",Alberto Longo 2007 Le Fossette Falanghina (Puglia)
"Another super Sauvignon Blanc that shows how well Lake County does with this variety. It's all about the citrus, fig and spicy melon flavors and the juicy acidity, which makes the wine so fresh and clean. Made from the Musqué clone.",X 2006 ES Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.",Godwin 2005 Floral Clone Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A fresh, intriguing wine whose balance and depth suggest midterm aging. Golden in color, it's succulent in the flavors of peaches, pineapples, limes, almond biscotti and butterscotch, with fine acidity and a rich, honeyed finish. Give it until sometime in 2008 and for another couple of years.",Hagafen 2006 Ripken Vineyard Roussanne (Lodi)
"The second wine from Malhadinha Nova is lively and fruity, packed with red fruits, sweet strawberry flavors and easy, ripe texture. Drink now.",Herdade da Malhadinha Nova 2006 Monte da Peceguina Red (Alentejano)
"With the '05, Bucklin is getting a handle on this old-vine field blend of two dozen varieties, which seems to do best in cooler years. It's a rustic-chic wine, with a brawny muscularity tamed by extreme dryness, and even though the alcohol is 15.6%, it doesn't feel too hot.",Bucklin 2005 Old Hill Ranch Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Soft and fruity, this Bordeaux blend has a splash of Syrah. It's dry and grippy in tannins, and there's a dried herb edge to the blackberry fruit. Finishes polished and elegant, but the softness suggests early drinking.",Corley 2004 Proprietary Red Wine Red (Oak Knoll District)
"An unexpected combination perhaps, but it works to give a fresh, flavorful wine, with soft tannins, juicy fruit and flavors of red cherries and vanilla. Not complex, and ready to drink now.",DFJ Vinhos 2004 Tinta Roriz and Merlot Red (Estremadura)
"Fresh green-apple aromas and some ripe, mango flavors, this is well rounded, showing some acidity, but more of open, fresh fruits. This is a wine that will be perfect to drink over the next few months.",DFJ Vinhos 2006 Monte Alentejano White (Alentejano)
"If all you're after is size, then sign on the dotted line. This blend is a monster that weighs in at 15.5%, so be ready for intensely sweet flavors of grape essence and licorice. To this judge, the wine has a lot of gumption but isn't what I'd want to drink glass after glass, day after day. It's lumbering, heavy but oh so sweet and dessert-like.",El Nido 2003 Clio Monastrell-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Jumilla)
"The wines of Backsberg have a distinctive, artistic quality to them that makes them ideal for collectors and drinkers who seek wines with style. This Pinotage has those qualities, with its layers of cinnamon and deep berry on the nose and smooth, integrated berry and smoke flavors. This is a real Pinotage so expect the rubbery smoke that goes along with it—but it's also elegant, offering structure and complexity with a gentle touch.",Backsberg 2005 Pinotage (Coastal Region)
"The grapes were grown on the Central Coast, mostly in Arroyo Grande, and the wine is characterized by vibrant acidity. There is an intense taste of raspberries, more usually found in a red variety like Grenache than a white wine, but Grenache Blanc consitutes nearly half the blend, along with Roussanne.",Bonny Doon 2005 Le Cigar Blanc White (California)
"This one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.",Codorníu NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cava)
"Thanks to its buoyant aromas of field flower, green apple, pear and dried sage leaf, you could definitely describe this as a multidimensional wine with noticeable elegance. There are musky, sweet fruit flavors on the finish.",Conte Collalto NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene)
"Schug's regular Pinot, as opposed to their Heritage Reserve, is a dependably village-style expression of easy-drinking, cool-climate Pinot Noir. The '06, like previous vintages, shows a silky, delicate texture framing cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a smoky vanilla edge of oak.",Schug 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",St. Clement 2004 Star Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",Arbios 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This is a dry Prosecco, meaning it is slightly sweeter than a brut or extra dry. Traditionally, Prosecco has this level of sugar, making it a very true rendition of what the wine is intended to taste like: Fresh peach, basil, pineapple, yellow apple and even an understated touch of banana come into play.",Adami NV Vigneto Giardino Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"One of the principle grapes of the Alentejo, Antão Vaz blends easily with the Arinto of neighboring Ribatejo. There is an attractive citrus element to this wood-aged wine, soft, open, but remaining fresh, the tropical fruit flavors well under control.",Alentex 2006 Antão Vaz-Arinto White (Alentejo)
"The idea here is to present a more structured and sophisticated Brut with emphasis on the nutty tones and mature peach. The wine succeeds in this regard but the whole point of Prosecco is to be light and fun; this ultimately lacks those sharp, well-defined fruit tones you might expect.",Bortolomiol 2005 Brut Millesimato Motus Vitae  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Here is a lighter, paler shade of Prosecco with opulent and cheerful soapy and herbal qualities (thanks to 10% Pinot Bianco) backed by lemon candy and polished mineral. Yellow apple and chalk are immediately recognizable. The mouthfeel is creamy and foamy with fresh crispness that is noticeable but not exaggerated.",Bortolotti NV Brut  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"There's a sweetmeat, salty leatheriness to this Pinot, like beef jerky. Give it a year or so to mellow out and let the smoky oak integrate with the ripe cherry, cola and raspberry flavors. Decant for an hour or two if you pop it open now.",Castle 2005 Sangiacomo Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Ginger ale and Sprite are the first things that come to mind when you give it a sniff. The palate shows ripe and sweet orange, tangerine and pink grapefruit, while the back end is lean and citrusy but far short of complex. Good in a standard way.",Codorníu NV Reserva Raventós Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"A bit heavy handed, with lots of tannins and acidity, and the jammy cherry-berry fruit is in your face. It's made in a big, bold style that will appeal to fruit-forward fans.",Ortman Family 2008 Turner Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Year after year, the Yasmin line from Recanati proves itself to be a fantastic value, and the 2009s are no exception. This 60% Merlot-40% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is fruit-driven but appropriately spiced with a lovely mocha-infused finish. The silky texture offers approachable, dusty tannins integrated throughout the medium-weight mouth.",Recanati 2009 Yasmin Kosher Red Red (Galilee)
"Perfect for a pairing with lasagna or meat cannelloni with bechamel sauce, this bright Chianti Classico has the natural acidity to cut though fatty food ingredients. The wine's aromas recall white cherry and raspberry.",Tenuta di Vignole 2007  Chianti Classico
"Lola is a 50-50 Cabernet Sauvignon/Syrah blend, smooth and supple, with a mix of purple berries, black cherry, cassis and smoke. The tannins finish a little green, and the Cab/Syrah combo seems to nullify the clear, varietal expression of either grape, but overall this is a well-crafted wine that could stand nicely alongside a hanger steak.",Two Vintners 2007 Lola Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Teeters on the verge of complexity, with dry, spicy flavors of raspberries and cherries. Good Carneros acidity makes for a brisk mouthfeel. Should develop for a year or three in the bottle.",X 2009 Truchard Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Minerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.",Albet I Noya 2009 Petit Albet White (Penedès)
"Avignonesi takes a traditionalists' approach to most of its wines, including this ruby-colored Rosso di Montepulciano. Slightly muddled aromas of cherry and dried raspberry mingle with tobacco, leather and spice.",Avignonesi 2008  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken. Green apple and citrus mingle with a hint of lemon custard on the nose, while the medium-weight mouth offers more green plum and white nectarine flavors. Flavorful and refreshing; drink now.",Binyamina 2009 Reserve Unoaked Kosher Chardonnay (Judean Hills)
"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.",Valserrano 2004  Rioja
"A plump, nicely concentrated Sauvignon Blanc, the 2009 Mount Beautiful doesn't have the most intense aromatics, but is holding on to its weighty melon and fig flavors and lingering citrus finish. Drink up.",Mt. Beautiful 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Canterbury)
"Sangiovese is enhanced by small percentages of Malvasia Nera and Colorino to deliver a plush, plump and satisfying Morellino from southern Tuscany. There's a nice feeling of informality here that makes this wine perfect for easy meals with family and friends.",Poggio Nardone 2008  Morellino di Scansano
"At first taste, the tannins dominate. Then fresher fruit shows through. The wine is firmly dry, the texture linear, the fruit showing some black currant character.",Château Ramafort 2008  Médoc
"Slightly more concentrated than other Marlborough Pinots in this price range, the 2008 Mana displays modest cherry fruit and an array of savory elements, including game, brine and peppery spice. It's a bit rough around the edges, yet in a charming sort of way. Drink now–2012.",Mana 2008 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice. This primary fruit tartness may be because the wine was bottled and rushed to market too early. Don't drink it now. Give it a year or two to integrate.",Drew 2009 Morning Dew Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Clove and dark Indian spice is the protagonist here and background aromas of cherry and moist earth play supporting roles. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with a bright, zesty close.",Giuliano Tiberi 2007 Le Vespe Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Made from an unknown blend of grapes, this nonvintage red is good, dry and versatile. It has juicy flavors of blackberries and pepper, with some extra layers of depth that make it a good value for a restaurant by-the-glass wine.",Greater Purpose NV White Label Red (Dry Creek Valley)
"Maybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.",Reina de Castilla 2009 Isabelino Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)
"This is a classic interpretation of Chianti Classico with bright aromas of small berry fruit, raspberry and blue flower. But there's also a modern touch as well that comes off aromatically as spice and new leather.",Rocca delle Macìe 2007  Chianti Classico
"This wine is missing great depth of flavor. It has bright acidity and hints of peach fruit flavors, but remains dull.",Joseph Drouhin 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé
"There's pineapple and sharp dill on the nose of this wine from a Gilroy-based producer. Once sipped, apple cider and a tinge of petrol flavors emerge.",Vino Vargas 2013 Olé Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"This is a generous, rounded and very perfumed wine. Candy and bubble gum flavors give sweetness that contrasts with the acidity.",Demessey 2012 Château de Messey Les Crets  (Mâcon-Chardonnay)
"Faithful to its label, this zero-degree residual-sugar Riesling is stark, steely and intensely dry. Bracing lemon acidity and tart green-apple flavors lend a tight, unyielding feel to the palate, but it's a refreshing accompaniment to creamy pasta or chicken dishes. Drink now.",Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 0 Degree Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"The wine is tight, green and herbal. It has some fruitiness, but that is suppressed by general underripeness. The tannins are hard at the end.",Joseph Drouhin 2011  Chorey-lès-Beaune
"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.",Knapp 2013 Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes)
"Funky aromas of farmyard, tire rubber and fetid flowers waft from the glass of this Nero d'Avola. The muddled palate offers stewed prune, overripe black plum and oaky vanilla alongside bitter, green sensations of old sage. Panebianco, Vinity.",Armosa 2008 Curma Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"Aromas of pressed apple and pear are savory and earthy on this brisk, medium-bodied Grüner Veltliner. There's a dusty minerality that lingers through the midpalate, but the finish is bright and lemony.",Fulkerson 2012 William Vigne Grüner Veltliner (Seneca Lake)
"Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",Stomping Ground 2012 Chardonnay (California)
"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Syrah is a chunky, slightly rustic style of Côtes-du-Rhône. It starts off with tar and herb aromas, then turns plummy and chocolaty on the palate. Drink now–2017.",L. Tramier & Fils 2012 Linteau Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Peach and apple aromas are fruity but not precise or minerally. This has peachy acidity but a wide, unfocused palate. Flavors of peach and nectarine are tasty but lack the crispness that Albariño is known for.",Lo Nuevo 2012 Covello Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This tight wine has red fruit acidity without the richness. With its green edge, it's likely to remain full of acidity even as it matures.",Pierre André 2011  Ladoix
"Made of Kinali Yapincak, a grape native to Turkey, this deep-straw colored wine does not give up much on the nose beyond a touch of apricot and just-washed cotton sheets. It does not seem wholly integrated on the palate, with chewy tannins overpowering flavors of melon, toast and white flower.",Suvla 2012 Kinali Yapincak (Thrace)
Pressed apple notes are touched with butter and creamed corn on this savory-style Chardonnay. It's rich and full on the palate with a satisfying silkiness that's brightened with lemony acidity.,Swedish Hill 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"The green fruit flavors dominate this very fresh, crisp wine. It has acidity as much as fruitiness, giving a steely, tight character. Drink now.",Chanson Père et Fils 2012  Viré-Clessé
Mild aromas of apple and generic white fruits are friendly enough. This has a monotone citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of tangerine and grapefruit. A bit of stalky corn and hay flavor rises up on the finish.,Coto de Hayas 2013 Chardonnay (Campo de Borja)
"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.",Demessey 2011 Les Hâtes  (Santenay)
"Tropical in character, this wine has soft acidity and an attractive texture. With ripe mango flavor, it's full in the mouth and ready to drink.",Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Viré-Clessé)
"Burnt caramel aromas give a wine that has weight, sweetness and packs in the vanilla. It misses out on real fruitiness, giving weight rather than freshness.",Domaine Sophie Cinier 2012  Mâcon-Fuissé
"Complicated, at times confusingly dank aromas of mushrooms, hops, dill and other wet herbs emerge from this bottling. Those atypical varietal characters find their way onto the palate as well, with olive and stewed mushrooms leading the way.",Fazeli Cellars 2009 Khayyam Cabernet Sauvignon (Temecula Valley)
"Lush and tropical with rich, ripe streaks of pineapple and mango, this medium-sweet Riesling is unabashedly forward and fruity, but hints of earth and dust on the midpalate lend a dark tone. Light on its feet, with a lemony finish.",Four Degrees of Riesling 2012 2nd Degree Medium Sweet Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Tight, acidic and very crisp, it's propelled forward by lemon zest and grapefruit flavors. It is bright, fruity and light in texture.",Pierre André 2012  Saint-Véran
"This soft, open wine has a light fruit character with attractive acidity and a crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",Jean-Marie Challand 2012 Les Tilles  (Mâcon-Villages)
"A vegetal wine that has acidity and rhubarb flavors. It is tight and full of acidity, with a very citrusy aftertaste. Drink now.",Joseph Burrier 2012 Château de Beauregard  (Saint-Véran)
"While pulpy and ripe on the nose with aromas of blackberry and cherry compote, this Cabernet Franc runs towards the savory side on the palate. Bold in body and alcohol, it's rich with red fruit, but has a musty, earthen tone that persists through the finish.",King's Garden Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"Dusty in tannins and planky in wood, this chewy red blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec into a mouthful of black olive, black currant and leather.",Laird 2011 Jillian's Blend Red (Napa Valley)
"Scents of fresh red cherries and bramble wood entice on the nose of this aromatic, spice-toned Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate, while crisp with cranberry acidity, is a bit subdued with subtle red-fruit flavor and a finish that wraps up short and tight.",McGregor 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"Raisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.",Bodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines  (Rioja)
"Gritty, intense, oaky and powerful from start to finish, this displays black-fruit aromas, hints of asphalt and an intense mouthfeel with a tight grip. A common duo of black-fruit and oaky flavors finishes with vanilla notes and a hint of coconut. Drink this structured, fully tannic RDD through 2028.",Protos 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"Electric lemon-lime acidity reverberates throughout this light-bodied Riesling. The palate is fruity, pulsing with sweet, fresh peach, apricot and tangerine flavors. The finish lingers on a delicately lacy sweetness.",Schloss Vollrads 2015 Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau)
"This hails from a 1,000–1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak. Balanced, the wine exudes lovely notes of boysenberry tart, blackberry and cedar, with a dusting of clove.",Sojourn 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"This is a rich, peppery and generously tannic and full-bodied expression of the grape, both powerful and brimming in grace. Soft and mellow on the midpalate, it builds up ripeness and texture toward the finish, ending with a satisfying bite of graham cracker and chocolate.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5–8 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.",Thorn Clarke 2014 Eden Trail Riesling (Eden Valley)
"This full-bodied wine has a big impact on the palate due to smoky, meaty flavors, very firm tannins and an overall huge personality. It starts with aromas of charcoal and charred oak, goes to ripe, rich but not sweet fruit flavors, and finishes with all that grip as well as lingering smoky nuances.",Aratás 2011 Shake Ridge Ranch Petite Sirah (Amador County)
"This wine has fine tannins, ripe berry fruits and well-integrated acidity. Rich and juicy, it offers blackberry flavors and a crisp aftertaste. Drink this wine, part of a range of wines from across Portugal, from 2018.",Santos & Seixo 2013 Santos da Casa Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"Subtle, well-balanced and rich in texture, this full-bodied wine sneaks up on the taste buds, starting with mild Bosc pear and toasted-almond aromas, then pouring richer pear, honey and hazelnut flavors onto the palate. A slight reserve in the flavors is more than offset by a quiet complexity and lingering finish.",Spicy Vines 2014 Joie de Vivre Chardonnay (Mendocino Ridge)
"Super-concentrated and intense, this starts with a very deep color and aromas like espresso and smoked meat. Flavors suggest black cherry and cranberry shaded with spices. An earthy, savory thread runs through all the dark fruit and spices, lingering on the finish.",Terra d'Oro 2014 Teroldego (Amador County)
"Planted in 1965, these are the oldest examples of this variety in the country. Jason Lett showcases this special fruit in this natural wine with no sulfites added and no cold stabilization. Light gold in color, the crisp apple flavors are forward, the balance is spot on and the finish polished. Drink now through 2020.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2015 Original Vines Pinot Gris (Dundee Hills)
"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea.",Tongue Dancer 2014 Putnam Vineyard Pinot de Ville Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This bone-dry and floral wine will taste great with simple appetizers like toasted nuts or fresh cheeses. It is very well concentrated and has medium to full body. An opulent texture helps carry the floral, appley, grapefruity flavors into the finish.",Uvaggio 2015 Secco Moscato (Lodi)
"A slightly bitter tobacco note frames black-cherry fruit. The tannins need more time to smooth out, and that bitter streak is a bit worrisome. But that said, this powerful deep compact wine may explode with flavor if you have the patience to cellar it. Drink after 2020.",WillaKenzie Estate 2014 Triple Black Slopes Pinot Noir
"This thoroughly delightful wine puts a polished sheen on this grape, that is so often lost in the shuffle between Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Here the clean and fresh flavors of grapefruit, white peach and melon mingle gracefully, with palate-pleasing texture and zippy acidity.",WillaKenzie Estate 2015 Estate Grown Pinot Blanc
"With a pronounced sensibility of caramelized apple and toasted brioche, this wine opens with a memorable lushness and richness that finds its balance in stony minerality. The highlights of flavor lean into golden pear compote and lemon zest, with a delicate seasoning of ginger.",William Harrison 2014 Sangiacomo Family Vineyards Chardonnay (Carneros)
"This is a beautifully perfumed wine, ripe with black fruits and generous with its tannins and acidity. It comes from a one-acre parcel called Le Vivier which has 70-year-old vines. It is concentrated, dense and with aging potential. Drink from 2018.",Yohan Lardy 2015 Le Vivier  (Fleurie)
"Coming from one of the state's most esteemed Syrah vineyards, this wine wins over fans by its brains rather than its brawn. High-toned aromas of dried herbs mix with notes of raspberry, blue fruit and iron. The flavors are fresh and layered, bringing a sense of vibrancy and deliciousness.",Avennia 2014 Arnaut Boushey Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"From century-old vines, this wine is potent and focused, with powerful, ripe fruit flavors and a texture that feels polished and precise. The aromas favor black cherry and black pepper, the flavors are fresh and mouth-filling, and the wine has firm acidity and tannins that make the texture appetizing.",Bella 2013 Big River Ranch Vineyard Series Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"The winery's flagship wine, Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half, with the balance Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Despite its age, it starts tight as a drum, with light aromas of spice, dark cherry, coffee and dried flowers. It's full flavored, with a dazzling richness to the textured fruit and barrel notes. Best after 2021.",Brian Carter Cellars 2012 Solesce Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A blend from two vineyards, this wine is rich and full bodied, with fine tannins and a dark concentration. With its perfumed character and tight structure, it is impressive, full of black fruits with a strong mineral streak. Drink this still-young wine from 2019.",Bulas 2010 Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"Though labeled as a Syrah, this drinks more like a GSM, with 11% Mourvèdre, 5% Grenache and 2% Viognier contributing prominently to the blend. Aromas of cocoa, orange peel, coffee grounds, raspberry and dark fruit are followed by full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors.",Cadaretta 2013 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A pretty light gold hue, this wine shines brightly from the first sniff to the last sip. It's clean and dense, with notes of bee pollen and lemon oil, flavors of apple and pear, and a touch of vanilla cookie.",Raptor Ridge 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Dusty minerals, pollen and spice notes lend complexity to this honey-toned auslese. The palate is decadently sweet, glazed in caramelized sugar and heaving with ripe cantaloupe and peach flavors. A bite of lemon-lime acidity offsets all the opulence, lending edge to a long, lingering finish.",Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2015 Bernkasteler Badstube Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Layers of exotic spice and crushed earth permeate through this dry Riesling paying just homage to it's red-clay origins in Ürziger Würzgarten, the spice garden of the Mosel. It's exquisitely light bodied, a revitalizing crush of cutting white grapefruit and lime flavors. The finish is marked by a meandering spray of spice and honey. Drinks well now but should improve through at least 2030.",Dr. Loosen 2012 Ürziger Würzgarten GG Réserve Alte Reben Erste Lage Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"Big and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke. The flavors are dry but enticing, with dark chocolate, charred beef and black cherry. It needs until at least 2022 to peak.",Meyer Family Cellars 2012 Petite Sirah (Yorkville Highlands)
"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches.",Ovum 2015 Memorista Tradition Riesling (Eola-Amity Hills)
"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025.",Perelada 2012 Finca Malaveïna Red (Empordà)
"The aromas jump up, with mesmerizing notes of fresh herbs, green olive, violets, orange peel, smoked meat and huckleberry. The palate shows a light but pillowy texture alongside flavors that carry on the finish. It's all about subtlety.",Proper 2014 Estate Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Produced in the Douro Superior region in the far east of the Douro Valley, this wine is dense with tarry tannins and black fruits. Wood aging and the concentration of old vines make it impressive. Drink now until 2022.",Quinta da Zaralhôa 2008 Reserva Red (Douro)
"The Reserve version of this brand, this young wine is ripe and firm, with great potential. The Duas Quintas (two estates) are Ervamoira and Bons Ares, both in the Douro Superior. With attractive smoky flavors and ripe red-berry fruits it will become a rich wine. Drink from 2020.",Ramos-Pinto 2014 Duas Quintas Reserva Red (Douro)
"Lemon pith and ripe peach aromas are clouded under a distinctly medicinal tone of baby aspirin. While there is nice roundness to the palate and balanced acidity to boot, the flavors are mild showings of orchard fruit and lemon curd.",Wyncroft 2013 Wren Song Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore)
"Lightly floral aromas are dilute while hinting at quince jelly. There's not a lot of vitality to the palate, while tangerine and nectarine flavors are watery. Pithy citrus notes carry the finish before it putters out.",Vicente Gandia 2014 Hoya de Cadenas Organic Verdejo (Spain)
"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors.",Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Chardonnay (San Juan)
"Bland aromas suggest applesauce. This varietal Xarello feels plump but flat. Candied, generic white-fruit flavors are nonspecific, while this offers up citrus notes and pyrazines on the finish.",Albet I Noya 2014 XA Xarel-lo (Penedès)
"From the producer's Old Vineyard Block, and blended with 20% Petite Sirah and 5% Syrah, this wine has a rustic barnyardy quality. It offers a tightness of dried herb around broad, sweet tannins, strawberry jam and chocolate.",Gustafson Family 2012 Mountain Cuvée Estate Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish.",JAQK Cellars 2013 High Roller Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Apple skin and guava rise out from a more buttery aroma that leads to oak on the palate. Light bodied, the wine finishes tart in lemon and lime.",Gracianna 2014 Suzanne's Blend Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Leafy, green aromas suggest eucalyptus and a briar patch. A lean palate offers aroma-matching flavors of green herbs along with plum, cherry and clay notes. This is oaky and resiny tasting on the finish, and hot as well.",Angulo Innocenti 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (La Consulta)
"This is on the light side, with simple flavors and a juicy, soft texture that shows very little tannin. Aromas and flavors recall cherries and strawberries.",Cable Car 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"Pruney and somewhat reduced, this thick offering of chocolate and blackberry jam needs food to mellow it out, preferably meat covered thickly in sauce.",Michael-Scott 2013 Zinfandel (Napa County-Sonoma County)
"Wiry, briary currant and herbal aromas announce a hard but juicy wine with buttery oak, salty red fruit flavors and a loud herbal angle. This is both briny tasting and a touch weedy on the finish.",Luis Segundo Correas 2013 Valle Las Acequias Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This is a rich, full wine that has red fruits and soft tannins. With balanced acidity, only a hint of tannins, it is ready to drink.",Parras Vinhos 2014 Montaria Tinto Red (Alentejano)

"Somewhat disjointed flavors mix subtle red fruits with cracker, licorice and coffee. So far the components have not smoothed out. It's a flavor jumble.",Schmidt 2012 Pinot Noir (Applegate Valley)
Faint notes of yuzu rise over underripe peach in this unoaked Chardonnay. The light-bodied palate shows a mild concentration of lemon leading to a short but clean finish.,Three Fires 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Lake Michigan Shore)
"Muddled aromas of tangerine, grapefruit and papaya seem a bit soapy in character. The palate feels a bit underripe, showing milky florals upfront and unconcentrated citrus on the back.",Verterra 2014 Dry Gewurztraminer (Leelanau Peninsula)
"The wine is fresh with red berry flavors and a stalky tannic core. It's lightly perfumed, light in texture and ready to drink.",Wine with Spirit 2013 Bastardo! Black Edition Tinto Red (Tejo)

Oily aromas of orange peel are inoffensive. A shearing palate offers little textural pleasure or complexity. Flavors of lemon and blood orange finish with a sour note of underripe pineapple.,Finca Salazar 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"This somewhat indistinctive wine has a wealth of minty aroma on the nose, a characteristic that doesn't shake off on the palate, the body full and a touch hot.",Buena Vista 2013 Private Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Yeasty aromas are devoid of fruit, commitment and minerality, and instead smell oddly floral and unconvincing. A waxy, wan palate and oaky flavors of clove finish with resiny, pushy spice notes. This tastes overly oaky and resiny, like the winery's Rioja white called La Capellanía but without the goods.",Pazo de Barrantes 2012 La Comtesse Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"The wine is fruity, although with a yeasty character that leaves a bready taste. It has acidity, ripe yellow fruits and the fruitiness may come to dominate although that is not certain.",Cooperativa Reguengos de Monsaraz 2014 Monsaraz Branco White (Alentejo)
"There's something mushroomy and feral about this wine, which finishes with sour cherry.",Armanino Family Cellars 2013 The Pintail Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)

"The nose isn't very expressive but you can detect whiffs of adhesive bandage, medicinal herb, apple skin and mineral that carry over to the diluted, rather bitter palate. Brisk acidity underscores the wine's lean character.",Lechthaler 2014 Drago Pinot Grigio (Trentino)
"While very flavorful, this wine is more of a dessert drink than a lunch or dinner wine. It smells sweet and earthy, feels unctous and tastes sweet, especially on the finish.",Coast 2013 Chardonnay (California)
"Candied raspberry aromas and a racy, acidic, crisp feel tell you what's coming: pie-cherry tartness and then a sizzle-and-pop finish that's fresh but astringent.",Pagos del Rey 2014 Altos de Tamaron  (Ribera del Duero)
"Balsamic aromas and strong pruney flavors combine for a heavy-handed taste in this full-bodied wine. It seems to be well-aged already, so drink it soon if you like this style.",Pat Paulsen Vineyards 2013 England-Shaw Vienyard Syrah (Solano County)
"Earthy and stemmy in dark black fruit, this wine contains 2% Syrah from Dunnigan Hills, though it's unclear how that contributes. Thin on the palate, it has a medicinal, minty flourish on the finish.",Mossback 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)

Rustic aromas are followed by rough-edged fruitiness in this young wine. It has ripe berry fruits as well as some firm tannins in the background. It is not yet integrated and needs to develop much more. Drink from 2018.,Quinta de Porrais 2012 Porrais Red (Douro)
"This light, bright wine comes from the north of the Vinho Verde region. It has freshly squeezed lemon juice with a touch of lime zest as well as spice. The lightest prickle on the tongue gives the wine a final lift.",Quintas de Melgaço 2014 QM Terra Antiga White (Vinho Verde)
"Chunky, slightly jammy plum and blackberry aromas are good but basic. In the mouth, this shows tartaric grit and bite along with lean fruit. Flavors of red plum and raspberry finish zesty but with hardly any complexity.",Tricky Rabbit 2012 Reserva Cabernet Franc-Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"This wine also contains 25% Zinfandel and is wildly savage in herb, baked plum jam, tobacco and a strong arm of oak. Midpalate, it takes on more savory peppercorn and herb over fruit, finishing mildly.",Bradford Mountain 2012 Grist Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"There's a slightly reductive quality on the nose of this wine, with rubber, tar, dill and hot lava rock notes. The palate shows roast beef char, sour cherry fruits and asphalt.",Consilience 2012 Petite Sirah (Santa Barbara County)
"A blend of two different vineyards, this ripe wine is now very mature. It has lost its primary fruitiness and developed toasty spice as well as a more funky, earthy character.",Domaine de la Pepière 2009 Cuvée 3  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"In this blend of Shiraz and Trincadeira, both grapes contribute red fruits, soft tannins and fresh-faced acidity. With no complications—just bright, juicy fruit—the wine is ready to drink.",Falua 2013 Tagus Creek Tinto Red (Alentejano)

"Similar to the winery's regular Pinot Noir, this is moving quickly along the aging curve. Hints of strawberry fruit are cloaked in barrel flavors of mocha and cracker. Drink soon.",Reustle 2013 Winemaker's Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"Red plum compote is at the center of this wine, a 100% varietal, with hearty bursts of herb and green pepper, as well as savory spice. From the cooler Coombsville appellation, it is soft, round and on the paler, thinner side of Napa's ripeness spectrum, more restrained.",Silverado 2011 Estate Grown Mt. George Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"The inaugural vintage of this wine, named for a water goddess, this offers herb, grass, lemon and peach around a medium body influenced by some oak. As it develops in the glass, tropical fruit unfurls in a refreshing spritz before settling down to a tart finish.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2013 Aveta Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"The wine is still young with its crisp red fruits and tense tannins. It is a structured wine, firm with a dry core and still developing its fruitiness. It will need to age a while yet, so drink from 2018.",Yohan Lardy 2015 Les Michelons  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"The aromas are light, with notes of freshly cut apple and spice. It drinks dry with elegantly styled fruit flavors that linger on the finish. It shows a very pretty styling.",Analemma 2014 Atavus Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Light strawberry fruit with tart acidity carries a wine of modest proportions. It's drinking well, and might be a good choice for a simple salmon preparation, as it would not overwhelm the fish. The finishing tannins have a definite herbal flavor.",Argyle 2014 Nuthouse Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Jammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors. The ripe warm finish is generous.",Chopo 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)
"Smooth and polished, this medium-bodied wine has attractive fruit and cinnamon aromas, generous dark-fruit flavors, and light touches of baking spices.",Meyer Family Cellars 2013 Syrah (Yorkville Highlands)
Aromas of vanilla and cocoa mix with red fruit. The fruit flavors are full and palate coating but the oak seems a little too intense at times.,Milbrandt 2012 Vineyard Series Clifton Vineyards Grenache (Wahluke Slope)
"Hibiscus and strawberry scents make an appealing invitation on the nose of this bottling, and then light cola and pepper spice up the ante. This would be a great red for warmer weather, served with a slight chill that would still allow the flavors of sandalwood, red cherry and marjoram to emerge.",MooBuzz 2015 G-S-M (Central Coast)
"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors.",Opolo 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Melon, nectarine and mild citrus aromas are clean and direct. This basic white is firm and balanced, while stone fruit, melon and white-pepper flavors end easy and fresh.",Palma Real 2015 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)

"Candied black cherry and fresh boysenberry aromas meet with darker touches of soy, teriyaki and burnt caramel on the nose of this bottling. The palate is mineral-driven, with light tar, asphalt and peppercorn flavors leading into dusty elderberry fruit.",Proulx 2014 The Wah Syrah (Paso Robles)
"The second wine of Vale Meão, this is rich and fruity. It has enough structure to allow it to develop while also having plenty of red-berry fruits and soft tannins. Give this wine until 2019.",Quinta do Vale Meão 2014 Meandro do Vale Meão Red (Douro)
Red-berry fruits and soft tannins give a wine with some juicy acidity and spice. The firm aftertaste shows that it is still needs time. Drink from 2018.,Quinta Dona Matilde 2013 Dona Matilde Reserva Red (Douro)
Spice from wood aging is the initial character of this wine. Then the fruit comes through more strongly to give the wine richness and structure. Drink from 2018.,Quinta dos Poços 2013 Reserva Red (Douro)
"Aromatics of rose and mint give this wine prettiness on the nose before getting into darker, richer components on the palate. Medium in build, it retains a sizable tannin presence in its youth, complemented by dark cherry and a char on the oak.",Robert Mondavi 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A mix of clones and vineyard sources, this is a bit rough and tumble, as the name might suggest. Hard cherry candy carries a touch of rubber, and some rugged tannins. That said, it's got plenty of punch and power.",Roco 2014 Gravel Road Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Earthy nose of dried underbrush, truffle and scorched soil give way to cranberry and sour cherry flavors. Dried herb and dark spice add some depth while tightly packed astringent tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish. It's rather straightforward but let the tannins relax for another few years then drink.",Tenuta Duecorti 2012 Castelletto  (Barolo)
"A blend of 85% Nebbiolo and 15% Uva Rara, this fragrant red boasts alluring scents of pressed rose, moist earth, aromatic herb and whiff of exotic spice. The racy straightforward palate doles out tart red cherry, star anise and a hint of clove alongside fine-grained tannins and firm acidity.",Podere ai Valloni 2014 Gratus Bio Red (Colline Novaresi)

"An innovative blend of Sauvignon Blanc (53%), Semillon (37%) and Viognier (10%), this medium-bodied wine delivers a mix of figs and melons, underscored by a silky texture. Ready to drink.",Wirra Wirra 2015 Scrubby Rise White (Adelaide)
"Cola, plum and red-currant aromas set up a tight palate with clamping tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis, plum and chocolate are lasting across the finish. This needs hearty food, additional airing or both to show its best.",Zolo 2015 Sustainably Farmed Estate Grown and Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Heady aromas like wood smoke, black pepper and new rubber tire lead to equally peppery, smoky flavors and a firm, nicely tannic texture. The wine is medium to full bodied and well concentrated.",Greystone Cellars 2014 Petite Sirah (California)

"From a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length.",Balletto 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of prune, blackberry, lemon peel and shoe polish are dark and earthy. This feels full and chewy, with hard tannins. Dark toasty black-fruit flavors come with herbal notes and wood spice flavors, while this tastes herbal, oaky, minty and like clove on the finish.",Cadus 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Agrelo)
"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate. Flavors of roasted plum and savory spices suggest lamb curry, while this feels robust and aggressive on a slightly hot finish.",Cadus 2014 Gualtallary Malbec (Mendoza)
"This very focused wine is deeply colored, has smoky, meaty aromas and concentrated fruit flavors. It is full bodied, firm and moderately tannic in texture.",Casto Oaks 2014 Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Pretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha.

Drink now.",Domaine de Gournier 2008 Viognier (Vin de Pays des Cévennes)

"Rather tough and gritty now, this bone dry wine offers herb, tobacco and cedar flavors, with suggestions of cherries and currants. It's the answer to folks who complain that California Cabernets are fruit and oak bombs. Could surprise with 5–7 years in the bottle.",Kings Mountain 2006 Meritage (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Cheerful and bright, this well-priced wine offers a great introduction to Barbaresco to those who might be less familiar with this noble Italian wine. Vibrant aromas include wild berries, cola and a touch of smoked ham. The mouthfeel is crisp and very clean despite the hot vintage.",Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2003 Cantina Tre Serre  (Barbaresco)
"Dry, minty and saucy on the nose, with an old-school sheer palate full of acidity, citrus, cherry tomato, herbs and snap.

The finish is long and lingering, with suggestions of vanilla ice cream topped with mixed berry compote. Drink now.",Recanati 2006 Reserve Kosher Merlot (Ella Valley)
"Though the winery indicates that just one quarter of the barrels (all French oak) were new, this wine puts those spicy, toasty scents and flavors of mocha and cinnamon front and center. It's soft and silky, with round, forward flavors of plums dipped in chocolate.",Bishop Creek Cellars 2007 Whole Cluster Reserve Pinot Noir
"A dry, spicy wine, with some good dense tannins. There is some power here, the dark fruits hinting at sweetness, but this is followed by the high acidity typical of the vintage. It should all come together in a year to 18 months.",Château Couhins-Lurton 2007  Pessac-Léognan
"There is plenty of wood, both in aromas and to taste. What is worrying is the dominance of the wood over the relatively light fruit character. There are just hints of Cabernet black currants, but then the wood closes in. It needs 3–4 years to come together.",Château Fonréaud 2007  Listrac-Médoc
"Good density here, with tannins that spring from bright berry fruits. The acidity is certainly present, but it has weight behind it, giving potential richness balanced by wood.",Château Lieujean 2007  Haut-Médoc
"A finely made wine, with elegant fruit and tannins, but definitely on the light side. The red berry fruits are soft and juicy, already a pleasure to drink, with only short-term aging.",Château Lynch-Moussas 2007  Pauillac

"A fragrant start brings raspberries and rose petals, along with traces of Dr. Pepper and cinnamon spice. In the mouth the wine fades a bit, not showing the depth that the aromas seem to promise. Good flavors, just a little light.",Left Coast Cellars 2008 Suzanne's Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Rounded, spicy wine with only light acidity and more of the lychee and mango side. It is ripe and generous, hinting at a dry core of firmness.",Lucien Albrecht 2009 Cuvée Marie Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Winemaker Morten Hallgren harnesses a traditional Italian grape-drying technique called appassimento to create this richly concentrated but dry Chardonnay.

"Chard fans will exult in this spicy wine. It packs a potent punch of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and honey, and is nicely balanced with crisp acidity.",Parkers Estate 2010 Blue Ash Road Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"The spectrum of varietal aromas is here: saline, olive, forest floor, tea and red and black fruits. Weighty and round in the mouth, with good feel and full blackberry flavors supported by creamy oak and vanilla. Juicy and red enough on the finish, where a pop of acidity registers.",Santa Ema 2009 Reserve Barrel Select Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"Topaz Imperial is Sparkling Pointe's first nonvintage blend of the three traditional Champagne grape varieties.

"Loosen's Grosses Gewächs bottling from old vines is plump, custardy and slightly sweet-tasting, buoyed by ample ripe apple and peach flavors and tinged with hints of lime, fern fronds and crushed stone. It might well have been more impressive served in a different (sweeter) flight; in this context it seemed slightly soft.",Dr. Loosen 2009 Ürziger Würzgarten Alte Reben GG Trocken Riesling (Mosel)
"Vacillates between seeming totally fresh and clean and showing herbal, light green notes. There's graham cracker, jammy blackberry and bergamot on the nose, but also a pickled element. Grabby, chunky and jammy in the mouth, with juicy acidity and blue fruit flavors.",Echeverria 2009 Reserva Syrah (Maipo Valley)
"A wine that is so perfumed, consummate pleasure to drink. It is soft as well as rich, the spice packed into a rounded structure. Drink now.",Emile Beyer 2009 Tradition Gewurztraminer (Alsace)

"While the nose on this unoaked Chardonnay is exuberant with billowing, ripe yellow stonefruit and floral aromas, the palate is quite brisk in style with a lean, steely acidity.

"Dark berry, herb and blue-fruit aromas lead to silky fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slightly sticky feel to the finish.",Lone Birch 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)

"One of Oregon's best-kept secrets is this well-made budget-priced Pinot from Eola Hills. Aged in French and American oak for just under one year, it's labeled as a plain Oregon AVA, but it's 95% Willamette Valley fruit. That brings an extra dimension to the wine, with some tannic muscle and a streak of dried leaf and forest floor flavors along with ripe strawberry fruit.",Eola Hills 2015 Pinot Noir (Oregon)

"This rating is probably as much a reflection of tasting the wine too late in its evolution as anything else. At this mature state, the wine is heavy and syrupy, with stalky, almost bitter red-fruit flavors. Finishes with matchstick and grassy flavors. Wait for the 2011.",Montes 2010 Cherub Rosé of Syrah Rosé (Colchagua Valley)
"Not quite ripe, with a green, vegetal streak cutting through the thin flavors of cherries. It's a soft, simple country wine.",Stickybeak 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This southern Oregon Syrah has red-fruit aromas, with notes of perfume and plastic.",3Fools 2009 Del Rio Red Red (Oregon)
"A strange wine that's not very aromatic beyond basic pear fruit and grass. Feels basic and tastes both green and oddly sweet, with a short, oily feeling finish that ends bitter. Tasted twice with similar findings.",Amayna 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"Feels flat and syrupy feeling, with sweet, herb flavors that suggest blueberry and baked plum. Finishes herbal.",Arauco 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"A bit unripe, with some vegetal flavors along with the blackberries. There's also a lot of sweet heat from high alcohol.",Castoro Cellars 2010 Zinfusion Reserve Zinfandel (Paso Robles)

"Sugary sweet and medicinal, like cherry cough syrup.",YN NV Red (California)
"Crisp but bland, with sharp edges and some bitterness on the finish.",Cousiño-Macul 2010 Sauvignon Gris (Maipo Valley)
"Overripe and Porty, with raisin, prune and chocolate flavors that finish hot and slightly sweet. The heat simply overwhelmed this Merlot.",Cerro Prieto 2008 Reserve Merlot (Paso Robles)

"Dilute, with simple strawberry flavors and a disjointed finish.",Melrose 2010 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"Funky and odd smelling, with exotic aromas that are unfamiliar and not that inviting. Feels thick and soupy, with black fruit flavors, cumin, candy and some bitterness on the finish.",Arauco 2011 Carmenère (Central Valley)
Aromas of strawberry sherbet are followed by sweet candy-shop flavors on the palate. Chill it thoroughly before drinking. Screwcap.,Viniverde 2011 Estreia Rosé (Vinho Verde)

"This 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot is one of the best red wines produced in Umbria. The Lamborghini family (of automotive fame) delivers a plush, modern—and yes, racy—red with dark concentration and generous tones of ripe cherry, vanilla and sweet spice. It has a chewy, plush feel in the mouth with bright freshness on the close.",Lamborghini 2005 Campoleone Red (Umbria)
"A finely constructed wine that is likely to age over many years. With its juicy currant flavors still dominated by minerality and citrus, there is some austerity. It is a complex wine showing great terroir character from the steep vineyard site.",Emmerich Knoll 2006 Ried Schütt Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"This vineyard, the “way to the church,” gives a full, rounded wine with very pure, direct fruit, and a green structure. This is an impressive wine that offers minerality as well as big fruit.",Rudi Pichler 2006 Wösendorfer Kirchweg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity.",Ojai 2006 Solomon Hills Special Bottling Two Barrels Made Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Sagemoor's old Cab vines comprise 79% of the blend. The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb. There is plenty of caramel and toast in the lingering finish, and this wine combines hedonistic power with depth and character.",Walla Walla Vintners 2005 Sagemoor Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Near perfect in the way it tastes almost sweet, then pulls back into dryness. The flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, peaches and honeysuckle are made even more delicious by the judicious application of new oak and sur lie aging.",Chalk Hill 2006 Estate Bottled Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill)
"Here's a big, rich, densely layered Syrah, the kind of wine that Cab or Merlot lovers who are looking for alternatives should discover. It's full-bodied, dry and oaky, yet with its cherry, chocolate, fig and licorice flavors, offers a whole different flavor profile. Brilliiant with pork tenderloin with a fruity sauce or stuffing.",Ojai 2004 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"A first from Pichler, this is a wine that stopped fermenting while still sweet and offers rich layers of honey, lychees and pepper are all here, as well yellow peaches and honeydew.",F X Pichler 2006 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",Forefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A classic Bordeaux blend. Tight and chewy, this fragrant wine adds whiffs of tobacco to its red currant and cherry fruit. It is a beautifully shaped wine, precise and balanced, compact and intriguing. It will reward decanting and should be cellared for a few years to give maximum enjoyment.",Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain)
"Bridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rhône variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich. Drink now and for a few years.",Bridlewood 2004 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Packed with superripe tropical fruits, this is a concentrated, powerful wine, with lychee and smoke flavors. There is intense acidity to counteract all the richness. Finishes sweet and ripe.",F X Pichler 2006 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.",Felipe Rutini 2004 Apartado Red (Mendoza)
"Rich in red currant, cassis, licorice, cola, vanilla cream and smoky oak flavors, with a smoothly tannic texture, this wine seems to be Cabernet-based. It's made solidly along Napa cult Cab lines, a softly voluptuous wine that's delicious now, and should age well for many years. From Hagafen.",Prix 2004 Reserve Melange Red (Napa Valley)
"This 95% Cabernet Sauvignon perfectly captures the vineyard's strengths: lush, ripe, fleshy fruit that shows perfectly ripened flavors of cherry and cassis, bolstered by ripe, chewy tannins. It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.",Soos Creek 2005 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Shows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure. New oak adds just the right touch of smoke and vanilla to this ageworthy 100% Cab. Best after 2010.",Parry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"The blend is classic Bordeaux—85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",Pepper Bridge 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade.",Smith-Madrone 2006 Chardonnay (Spring Mountain District)
"Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now.",Rancho Sisquoc 2007 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County)
"This has so much raw, rough oak flavor when first opened that the fruit is nearly invisible. Tempranillo may well have a real future in the Walla Walla Valley, but first it has to be freed from the woods. Give this plenty of breathing time.",Righteous 2008 Righteous Tempranillo (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",Crossbarn by Paul Hobbs 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Tomato leaf, herb and spice aromas mix with green-leaning raspberry and marshmallow sweetness on the nose. The palate is gritty and tough, with salty, herbal cherry and brambly flavors. Short and choppy on the finish.",Espiritu de Chile 2007 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Curicó Valley)
"Light and herbal, with a modest core of grapefruit flavors. Grassy notes soften on the finish, allowing some chalky notes to come through. Drink up.",Frenzy 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made from Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, this is a very flavorful wine, with rich blackberry, black currant, cocoa and cedar flavors. But it's very sharp in acidity, with a jalapeño pepper burn that limits its appeal.",Happy Canyon Vineyard 2009 Chukker Red (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Soft and simple, with slightly sweet pie-filling flavors of cherries and mocha. A decent, everyday wine for picnics, barbecue and such.",181 2008 Merlot (Lodi)

"A fresh, high-acid wine, with flavors of raspberry and apple. It's crisp, with fruit that is barely ripe. Needs plenty of chilling.",Provence Rosé 2009 Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Honey-sweet in orange and vanilla flavors, this wine has a good backbone of acidity that makes it crisp and clean. Drink it with vanilla desserts or even cheesecake.",Redtree 2009 Moscato (California)
"Opens with a mix of toast and dusty, herbal aromas, and with time it turns more saucy than precisely fruity. A bulky wine with a chunky mouthfeel and fleshy flavors of herbal plum. A late wave of tartness and more herbal flavors cements things into place.",Santa Ema 2008 Selected Terroir Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A fruity, direct Chardonnay that will appeal to fans for its peach, pear and oak flavors. Not especially complicated, but a fine example of the variety at a good price.",Shiloh Road 2008 Chardonnay (North Coast)

"The old saying, you get what you pay for, is perfectly illustrated by this simple Pinot Noir. It's not bad, though, and at this price, will perform the useful function of introducing budding Pinotphiles to the variety.",Lucky Star 2009 Pinot Noir (California)
"This seems to be an attempt at an Italianate style, with modest alcohol levels (11%) and the accompanying lack of fruit expression. It's largely neutral, with hints of underripe pear and white pepper that combine with chalky notes on the finish.",Jacob's Creek 2009 Pinot Grigio (South Eastern Australia)
"“The Affair” refers to the relationship between the French and Italian varieties in the blend. Sadly, this isn't the hottest affair, with the strong game, red currant, strawberry hull, milk chocolate and smoky dried salami notes all downplayed by the lean mouth and waxy finish.",La Vierge 2008 Temptation The Affair Red (Walker Bay)
"Not disappointing given the price. There's some toast and tropical fruit on the nose, and then pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity runs a bit sharp, but overall this is a reasonable, warm-climate, tropical Chard for the money.",Luis Felipe Edwards 2009 Reserva Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"Immediate aromas of chalk and peach waft up from the glass, followed by flavors of green lime and asparagus in the round mouth. The finish is a little heavy, but the flavors are nice and it should be a nice companion to summery soups and grilled vegetables.",MAN Vintners 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Nice herbal notes unfold in the bouquet with notes of lime rind, underripe peach and soft bell pepper coming through in the mouth. The finish is clean, like fresh-cut grass, and the overall experience enjoyable.",Nederburg 2009 Manor House Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)

"A bit broad on the palate, this wine offers ample melon and fig flavors but lacks that vibrant zesty character that so often sets Marlborough Sauvignon apart from the pack. Drink now.",Seresin 2009 Momo Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Firm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice. Light in texture and weight the wine still offers a sense of place and gravitas.",Chasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Pale in color, this is dominated by its taut, nervy structure. Crisp red currant and red apple flavors give the fruitiness. A ripe, full-bodied mouthfeel brings out a softer, riper aftertaste.",Ruinart NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Planted in 2001 above the Laguna de Santa Rosa near Sebastopol, Baranoff Vineyard is tightly spaced to mostly Calera-clone Pinot, providing the wine's bright raspberry and cherry overtones atop a layering of earth and spice. Thickly structured, it finishes with tart cherry.",Small Vines 2012 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Kopke has an impressive quantity of old tawnies, some of which will have ended up in this wine. It certainly seems older than its 20 years with strong wood flavors, smoky toast and beautiful mature acidity. It is very ready to drink, a fine mature tawny.",Kopke NV 20-Years-Old Tawny  (Port)
"Soft and full-bodied, this offers bright apple and citrus fruits layered with toast from wood aging. Under the broad exterior, the wine is developing more tangy, zesty fruits and a tight texture. It needs to age to bring everything together. Drink from 2017.",La Chablisienne 2012 Vaillons Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is an austere wine, packed with tannins and tight acidity. The red fruits are right at the back behind the firm structure. A mineral character supports the dusty texture and suggests long-term aging. Drink from 2018.",Albert Morot 2012 Cent-Vignes Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Oaky, heavily roasted aromas of hickory, baking spices, coconut and exotic black-fruit scents feed into a chunky but easygoing palate with spicy, barrel-rich flavors of hickory and vanilla as well as baked berry and leather. A ripe, slightly rubbery finish is generous. Drink through 2018.",Alto Moncayo 2010 Veraton Garnacha (Campo de Borja)
"Already showing some toasty maturity, this blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir is delicate, yeasty and rounded. Coming from northern Burgundy, it has a cool climate feel, textured with orange zest and the crispest acidity. It is ready to drink, although another few years in bottle will improve it even more.",Bailly-Lapierre 2011 Egarade  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
"Made from 80-year-old Glera vines that have never been doused with herbicides or pesticides, this boasts an enticing floral fragrance of jasmine and honeysuckle. The elegant, reserved palate has a pristine quality, delivering green apple, lemon zest, nectarine, pastry cream, herb and mineral alongside a fine perlage. It finishes crisp and clean.",Ca' dei Zago 2012 Dosaggio Zero  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)

The creamy flavors are brightened by lively acidity.",Ca' del Bosco 2009 Vintage Collection Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"An amazingly vivid nose of cherry, eucalyptus and morning dew on wild fennel promises a stunning wine in this clonal combo from Morgan. The flavors aren't quite so mind-blowing, though, as basic fruit-punch elements meet with touches of peppercorn and nutmeg.",Morgan 2012 Twelve Clones Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a full, round, woody bottling, with graphite, leather and mild herbal aromas. The palate feel is concentrated but also tannic and grating. Flavors of bold black fruits, herbs and barrel resin finish tight, with residual raw oak in abundance. Drink through 2018.",Pittacum 2010 Aurea Mencía (Bierzo)
"Blanc de Noirs, white Champagne only from red grapes, produces wines with some weight, as here. It makes for a rich, full-blooded Champagne, packed with red fruits while also cut through with intense acidity. The fruitiness gains shape from a zesty texture.",Tendil & Lombardi NV Blanc de Noirs Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"This is an elegant Champagne, with a burgeoning sense of maturity as well as fresh acidity. Flavors of ripe pear are cut with a light touch of lemon while the overall texture is soft and on the sweet side of Brut. It could age a few more years, so drink now and until 2019.",Veuve Doussot 2006 Memory Brut  (Champagne)
"Tilled earth, blue flower, leather, blueberry and cured meat aromas jump out of the glass of this concentrated wine. The rich palate delivers black berry, licorice, chocolate, clove and black pepper alongside firm, chewy tannins. Drink 2016–2023.",Villa Erbice 2008 Tremenel  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich. Flavors of baked black fruits and brown sugar finish sticky, with chunky weight. Drink through 2018.",Clos de Chacras 2010 Gran Estirpe Red (Mendoza)
"Scents of honey and freshly pressed apples waft from this delicate sweet Riesling. Bright, sunny peach flavor dominates the palate, but is pierced with a startling vein of lemon acidity.

"Perfectly capturing the AVA's signature mix of herb, leaf, wild berry and white pepper in a compelling nose, this rolls into a full midpalate that is flush with tangy pie-cherry fruit. Some tasters may find it pushes a bit too far toward the herbal flavors. The overall balance is lovely.",Evening Land 2012 Seven Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Initial aromas are oaky and a touch raw, but soon they settle on raspberry and plum. This is a chunky, fruit-forward Mencia with dark berry, raspberry, spice, resiny oak and salty flavors. A full, lively finish is muscular but also fresh and bright. It had only eight months in oak; drink now through 2015.",Gancedo 2012 Mencía (Bierzo)
"Beautifully perfumed, this has ripe blackberry flavors and a relatively dry character.

"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance.

Drink through 2018.",Septima 2010 Gran Reserva Red (Mendoza)

"With a vineyard planted in the traditional Beaujolais style of individual bushes rather than trained on wires, this is a light, soft and fruity wine. It has attractive tannins and fresh red fruits. Drink now.",Georges Duboeuf 2015 Château des Vierres  (Beaujolais-Villages)

"Herbal aromas of tomato leaf and earthy plum are a bit green. This feels chunky, with some grab. Herbal plum flavors are like the nose, meaning they lean towards green. Finishing flavors of olive, spice and herbs are common for value-priced Chilean Cabernet.",Viña Requingua 2014 Puerto Viejo Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)
"Aromas of weedy underbrush, oak, menthol and a toasted note emerge in the glass. On the lean, one-dimensional palate, suggestions of vanilla and bitter almond accent raw sour cherry.",Poggio di Sotto 2013  Rosso di Montalcino

"Winemaker Ray Coursen is a Vietnam Vet, and this wine is made to honor other veterans of foreign wars. Soft, round and approachable on the palate, it's made from a majority of Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Cedar, currant and a sweetness of vanilla fan out on the palate.",Purple Heart Wines 2013 Red (Napa Valley)
Cherry and raspberry aromas are fragile and sketchy but not broken. This value-priced Cabernet shows a midlevel palate with moderate concentration. Herbal plum and raspberry flavors finish easy.,Santa Luz 2014 Alba Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)

"This is a sweeter and fruity take on the grape, beginning with a nose of fresh and vibrant boysenberry fruit and wet-asphalt minerality. The palate is tasty in a hedonistic way, but very primary, with flavors of fruit punch.",Clayhouse 2014 Red Cedar Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
There is an earthy character to this wine. It gives a dry edge to the black fruits and crisp acidity. The wine has the tannins typical of the appellation although it also has a light herbal touch that is less attractive. Drink now.,Domaine de Leyre-Loup 2014  Morgon
"There's a subtlety to the bouquet of this wine, showing dainty scents of yellow apple, just-dried hay and orange peel. The palate offers more intensity and verve, with notes of citrus pith, melon rind and saline that linger softly on the refreshing finish. Enjoy now.",Domaine Delsol 2015  Picpoul de Pinet
Some overripe fruit on the nose derives a little more shape from the lemon acidity of the dry palate. The body is slightly dilute but finishes clean.,Domaine Fritz Schmitt 2015 Riesling (Alsace)

"This Elqui Syrah is topped with resiny oak aromas that emphasize clove and nutmeg. Big, full-bodied, sticky and tannic, this barrel-heavy wine tastes charred, toasty and burnt, with chocolate and campfire notes to the finish.",Elqui Wines 2013 Limited Release Carmenère (Elqui Valley)

"Still settling into its skin, this wine shows a light effervescence when first poured that lifts the notes of freshly cut pear, mandarin orange and wild flowers. It drinks off dry, with the concentration of the stone fruit flavors somewhat wanting.",Jones of Washington 2013 Riesling (Ancient Lakes)

"Grown in a celebrated vineyard, this Pinot isn't showing well at this point. It's heavy and soft, and the raspberry-cherry flavors are compromised by a vegetal quality. Decant and drink up.",Sojourn 2012 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

"A straightforward wine with notes of plum, currant and herbs. The flavors are lighter in style supported by firm tannins.",Wild Meadows 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))

A touch of menthol highlights a cool, acidic edge on the palate. Finishes moderately long with a murmur of fine-grained tannins.",Benmarl 2012 Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake)
"This is all estate-grown from the original (2004) planting. Tannins are smooth and the wine has a pleasing chocolate streak upon entry. Peppery and herbal highlights come into play through the finish, which firms up nicely.",Hightower 2011 Murray Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Wild cherry, violet, underbrush and spice aromas lead the nose on this bright red. The palate is still tight and tannic but offers juicy black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon alongside vibrant acidity. Best after 2015.",Il Grillesino 2010 Riserva  (Morellino di Scansano)

"Just a smidge over the edge into off dry, this is a big, juicy wine with a luscious mix of tropical candy fruit flavors. It's like tasting an entire roll of tropical Life Savers all in a glass. The residual sugar is offset with balancing acidity, and it's a versatile wine that can accompany a wide range of slightly spicy foods.",Mercer 2013 Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"This new vintage is head and shoulders better than the previous effort. Light and pretty, with a delicate mix of citrus, melon, tangerine, lemon and lime, it's showing good length and impressive detail.",Mercer Canyons 2013 Riesling (Yakima Valley)

"Unusual aromas of blue fruits are matched against cardamom and cumin scents. The palate is blocky yet dominated by acidity, while flavors of plum, black currant and woodspice are exotic. A hard finish shows hickory and barrel flavors along with wiry acidity.",Baigorri 2007 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Ripe blackberry aromas carry notes of prune and raisin. For a ripe, dark wine, this is juicy and well balanced.

"Vivid fruit flavors light up this extroverted Viognier, starting in the aroma and lasting through the long finish. It tastes like apricot, orange, pineapple, vanilla and cream. Good acidity keeps it lively and fresh, balancing the full body.",Cedar View Winery 2013 Reserve Viognier (California)
"This is a generous, ripe wine, full of red fruits and soft acidity. It's already enjoyable, but will benefit from aging until 2015 to bring out the refreshing fruitiness even more.",Château de Corcelles 2012  Beaujolais-Villages
"Heavily wooded, the wine is essentially toast with a touch of fruit. Of course, it is young, and the rich black fruits behind all this smokiness will come through. Drink after 2019.",Château de Gaudou 2012 Renaissance Malbec (Cahors)
"Les Cimels is a solid, entry-level Costières de Nîmes blend of Syrah, Carignan and Grenache.

Long and mouthwatering on the finish.",Château d'Or et de Gueules 2012 Les Cimels Red (Costières de Nîmes)
"Dominated by ripe Sémillon, this is a rich wine. It has a touch of herbaceousness, but the yellow fruits, pears and stroke of lemon give a full-bodied, rounded feel. Wood aging adds further to the satisfying flavors.",Château Tour des Gendres 2013 Cuvée des Conti White (Bergerac Sec)
"Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017.",Montemercurio 2007 Damo  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)

"This is a strong, firm wine with an initially earthy aroma that fills out with the scent of dark black fruits. The structure of the wine is taut, dark and brooding, offering serious potential for aging. Its bold acidity and young tannins further suggest aging, so drink between 2016–2024. Langdon Shiverick, Comète Wines.",Quinta do Pinto 2010 Touriga Nacional (Lisboa)
"You'll have to go far and wide to find a bigger, richer California Chardonnay. It's enormous, offering an explosion of tropical fruit, citrus and apricot, brightened by crisp acidity. Despite the power, the wine maintains elegance and balance. This is one of the few Chards that will take bottle age, gradually losing fruit. Drink now–2018.",Qupé 2010 Bien Nacido Reserve Block Eleven Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Typical of the best 2009 Riojas, this is aromatic with scents of berry fruits, graphite and spice all mixed to the right proportions. A well-structured palate features firm but flexible tannins and fresh flavors of plum, berry, spice and mocha. On the finish, darkness takes over in the form of espresso, peppercorn and bitter chocolate flavors. This can be drunk now but will benefit from another 5–10 years of aging.",Pujanza 2009 Norte  (Rioja)
"A gigantic Pinot Noir, rich and heady in black cherries, sweet licorice, bacon, mocha and toasty oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins and brightened with crisp Santa Lucia acidity. It's a dramatic wine, but too young. Give it at least four years for all the parts to begin to come together.",Roar 2011 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Now in golden maturity, this is a smooth, unctuous and ripe wine. Honey is the dominant character, a perfumed wild flower honey that is layered with intense acidity that lifts the wine in a beautiful way. A sweet wine yes, but one that is so balanced.",Domaine des Baumard 2003 Cuvée le Paon Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon)
"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush. Believe it or not, this is actually drinkable now, yet should age easily through at least 2025.",Jean-Luc Colombo 2009 Les Ruchets  (Cornas)
"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time. It's full bodied and a bit coarsely textured for the moment, but finishes long and will clearly benefit from cellaring. Drink 2018–2025.",Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Saint Pierre  (Cornas)
"This shows floral and underbrush aromas of violet, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate offers ripe black cherry, red currant, Asian spice and toasted notes. It's structured yet elegant, with firm but fine tannins and nice depth. It's ready now, so enjoy soon.",Villa S. Anna 2009  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",Testarossa 2010 Brosseau Vineyard Chardonnay (Chalone)
"Awesomely rich in black cherries, plums, licorice, mocha, cola and sweet oak flavors. Made from selected barrels of the winery's various vineyards around the state, its richness is balanced by brisk acidity and a soft scour of tannins. Drink over the next six years.",Testarossa 2010 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California)
"Mango aromas drive this rich wine, full of honey as well as spicy fruits. It is not so much weighty as intense, with a sense of warmth. Now mature and ready to drink, it still retains a youthful fruit character.",Louis Sipp 2008 Osterberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"This hallmark Chianti Classico boasts a heady perfume of violet, underbrush, peach blossom and clove. The palate delivers bright red fruit, pepper and cinnamon with crushed cherry in the forefront. It's nicely balanced and should develop complexity over the next few years but is already delicious.",San Giusto a Rentennano 2010  Chianti Classico
"Massive fruity extract characterizes this Cabernet. With noble tannins and explosive black currant, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it defines the modern Napa cult style of soft, delicious complexity. Good to go now, but you're better off holding it for 8–12 years.",Black Coyote 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is perfectly balanced dry Chenin. It has just the right amount of richness, aided by a touch of vanilla. The green and white fruits are blended with deceptively soft acidity to give a wine that feels full and ripe in the mouth. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 3–4 years and more. Screwcap.",Domaine des Baumard 2010  Savennières
"Mango aromas and flavors give a sense of the sweetness of the wine. It is rich and full bodied, with spice and pepper notes just hinting at acidity. Keep the wine for 3–5 years.",Domaine Ehrhart 2010 Brand Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"The name is an oblique reference to Shiraz, which forms the basis of this cuvée. It's inky in hue and rather reticent on the nose at first. But swirl it vigorously and be rewarded with layers of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Full bodied, rich and tannic, its blueberry and cassis fruit lingers on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink 2015–2025.",Domaine de Fondrèche 2009 Persia Red (Ventoux)
"Here's a classically crafted selection, with a lovely floral and earthy fragrance. The palate shows dark-plum and black-cherry flavors laced with white pepper, mint and balsamic accents. While it has tame acidity, it's still tightly wound and needs just a few years to soften and develop additional complexity; drink after 2015. Vi Wines, J & J Importers.",Antico Colle 2010  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano
VV refers to the old vines that are at the heart of this impressive wine. It has great concentration both from the richly structured fruit and tannins. New wood comes through richly on this powerhouse of texture and density. Give the wine at least six years to mature.,Wine & Soul 2010 Quinta da Manoella VV Red (Douro)
"Floral and black fruit aromas are punctuated by spicy notes on the nose of this wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black-cherry, white pepper, mint and sage along with big but ripe tannins and edgy acidity. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2015–2020.",Istine 2010  Chianti Classico
"An opulent feeling Riesling, full of peach and pineapple flavors. It's ripe, full in the mouth and textured, its richness masking the dryness of the fruit and the acidity. It could age a few more years—give it 2–4.",Joseph Fritsch 2010 Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Retro makes one of the best, most consistent Petite Sirahs in California. Even though they used to source their fruit from Howell Mountain and this bottling now is from Pope Valley and Calistoga, it still shows the same qualities of complex interest based on impeccable winemaking. It's an amazing wine, dry, full-bodied and tannic, with a complex range of berries, currants, herbs and white pepper. Truly a Petite Sirah for Cabernet lovers. Drink now–2020.",Retro 2009 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"This Pinot Noir is from the far or “true” Sonoma Coast, near Annapolis, north of the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. It shows its origin in the brisk acidity and delicacy of mouthfeel, as well as the fantastic range of wild red berry, cola, pine, nettle and white pepper flavors that change from second to second. New oak brings toasty, vanilla complexities and wood tannins. This is a delicious wine now, but will age gracefully for at least eight years.",Sojourn 2011 Ridgetop Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Ikon refers to Touriga Nacional's position as Portugal's iconic grape. It is almost black in color, and profoundly dense and dry with wood tannins at this early stage of development. Yet it promises a palate that's rich and smooth with fruit in time. It's intended for long-term aging so drink from 2017.",Fiuza 2011 Ikon Touriga Nacional (Tejo)
"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",Bibbiano 2010  Chianti Classico
"This is a smooth, impressively rich wine powered by silky tannins and ripe black fruits. The palate is intensely concentrated with a big, bold structure and a solid feel. It does need some aging, so drink from 2016.",Wines & Winemakers 2009 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva Red (Douro)
"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas. The mouthwatering palate shows concentrated wild-cherry flavor layered with mint, white pepper and clove. It has fresh acidity and firm tannins that will develop complexity with more bottle age. A textbook Chianti Classico.",Castellinuzza e Piuca 2010  Chianti Classico

Honeyed fruits show right at the end. Drink from 2014.",Domaine Schoffit 2009 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Masses of cherries and raspberries in this single-vineyard wine, and also lots of acidity. It cuts across the palate like a squeeze of lime juice, tart and mouthwatering. Oak shows up in this equation as sweet buttered toast. Altogether, it's a complex, elegant, delicious wine that will develop bottle bouquet over the next 10 years.",Gary Farrell 2011 Hallberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Calidonio is a fascinating and deeply layered wine that is remarkable off the bat thanks to its unique personality and compelling aromatic profile. Piedirosso (85%) is fermented in oak with 15% Aglianico to create tones of black fruit, spicy smoked meat, resin and black licorice. It is smooth and very soft on the close.",Ocone 2008 Calidonio Red (Taburno)
"Vintner Salvatore Geraci is the proud producer of Palari Faro, one of the great red wines to emerge from the Mediterranean rim and the island of Sicily. The elegance and finesse is extraordinary and the wine opens with a complex bouquet that sees petite elements of cassis, licorice, tar and tobacco rolled into one.",Palari 2007  Faro
"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",Round Pond 2008 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A lovely effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm, this plump, creamy-textured spätlese displays ample minerality—there's a distinctly slate-driven note—allied to ripe apple, stone fruit and citrus. Sweet but not overwhelmingly so, this would be terrific with slightly sweet or spicy dishes.",S.A. Prüm 2009 Graacher Himmelreich Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Spicy and assertive, this young, cellar-worthy Pinot Noir just hints at the complexity within. Give it plenty of air time and it opens aromatically with allspice, sandalwood, perhaps some cola and pine needle. The tart and tangy berry fruit is still compact and primary, but fully ripe and nicely sculpted into a well-defined wine from start to finish.",Archery Summit 2008 Arcus Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Old vines, at least 60 years old, are the basis for this soft, wood-aged wine. The texture is smooth, with rounded tannins and density. Flavors include licorice, bittersweet chocolate and black cherries.",Bernard Baudry 2009 Les Grézeaux  (Chinon)
"This is firmly, tannic, the product of oak cask fermentation as well as aging. The tannins promise long aging, while the ripe black jelly fruit character brings out the richness of the vintage.",Charles Joguet 2009 Clos du Chêne Vert  (Chinon)
"A wine that combines the richness of the vintage with the extreme flinty texture of young, dry Chenin Blanc. Packed with ripe acidity, it is pure, very crisp, yet for aging.",Château d'Epire 2009 Cuvée Spéciale  (Savennières)
"Made in a ripe, soft style that's unusual for Howell Mountain, this Zin could almost be Grenache, or even a big Pinot Noir. The cherry pie filling, raspberry cream and Dr. Pepper flavors are wrapped into soft, gentle tannins. It's a luxurious, exotic Zinfandel whose heat from high alcohol adds a spicy element.",Dark Matter 2006 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"Hails from Macul, so it exhibits some normal eucalyptus on the nose along with spice and pointed, slightly piercing berry aromas. The palate is chewy, sweet, modern and ripe, with chunky berry, herb, olive and particularly graphite flavors. Settles on big black fruit and depth. Outstanding Chilean Cabernet with individuality. Best from 2013-2016.",Domus Aurea 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"A huge wine, explosive in ripe fruit, elaborated with rich oak and wrapped into smooth, sweet tannins. Made from vineyards throughout the county, it dazzles with a complex of blackberry jam, mocha, date, bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. Really impressive, especially at this price. Drink Now–2015.",Rusack 2008 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"This Pinot Noir needs a few years in the cellar to mellow, although you can decant it now to let it breathe. It's very rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and sweet, smoky oak, with a soft, silky texture. Shows a real sense of sophistication.",Thomas Fogarty 2008 Windy Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward.",Tudal 2008 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This interesting wine is an unusual blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varieties with nearly half Syrah. It does what Napa does so well, offering a plethora of ripe, delicious cherry, black raspberry, dark chocolate, sweetly smoked oak and peppery spice flavors that are deep and long on the finish. A lovely, accessible wine to drink over the next few years.",Viader 2008 Estate Limited Edition Red (Napa Valley)
"A great Viognier, rich and exotic, showing the powerful fruit you want from this variety, in a balanced, elegant way. With a sweet, buttercream mouthfeel, it's brisk in acidity, with powerful flavors of tangerines, pineapples, golden mango and exotic spices, finished with smoky, sweet oak.",Zotovich Cellars 2010 Estate Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills)
"From 29-year-old Pinot Nero vines, Pinéro is an elegant and fine still red wine produced by one of Italy's most celebrated sparkling wine houses. Polished and finessed down to the smallest detail (those tiny berry aromas come forth so clearly), this wine shows the potential of the Burgundian variety in Italy.",Ca' del Bosco 2006 Pinéro Pinot Nero (Sebino)
Classic. Beautiful acidity is balanced by just a touch of sweetness. The wine is bright with apple and lime flavors.,Domaine Huët 2010 Le Haut-Lieu Sec  (Vouvray)
"Very young, needs plenty of time. Still showing fermentation notes, with brisk, grapey acidity and primary cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Seems brilliantly constructed and capable of aging, though. Hold until after 2012.",Donelan 2009 Walker Vine Hill Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"The combination of very high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar gives this Grenache an excessively sweet, glyceriney taste. It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",Beckmen 2008 Purisima Mountain Vineyard Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A field blend ice wine—don't see that very often—it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruits—tropical, stone fruits and citrus. Concentrated and poised, it balances on fresh acidity. Just a hint of plastic in the back of the finish.",Viento 2009 Underwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Gewürztraminer-Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"Camarato is a beautiful wine and the 2004 vintage shows impressive harmony and elegance. The wine opens with aromas of chocolate, black cherry and spice. In the mouth, it shows firm, enduring tannins. Pair it with a succulent steak.",Villa Matilde 2004 Camarato Red (Falerno del Massico)
"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a négociant's blend, is really delicious. It's rich, dry, tannic and lush in blackberry and cherry tart, chocolate and smoky cedar flavors.",Wine Spots 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The best Clos Pegase Sauvignon Blanc in years. Made with a little oak, just enough for creaminess, it's marked by vibrant acidity and complex, lovely flavors of lemongrass, Meyer lemon candy, vanilla, white pepper and the distinct minerality that Carneros white wines often display. Great price for a wine this sophisticated.",Clos Pegase 2009 Mitsuko's Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Carneros)
"A finely crafted wine, its tight acidity generating a very fresh profile. There is an intensity of fruit as well as a mineral texture. For aging. Screwcap.",Domaine des Baumard 2007 Clos de Saint-Yves  (Savennières)
"The Thanisch wines from the Doctor vineyard rarely stand out in our magazine's blind tastings, making their value proposition questionable. That said, this is a finely elegant wine, with floral details on the nose and enduring stony notes on the finish that mark it as something special. At only 7.5% abv, you'd expect an intensely sweet wine, but the sugars are amply buffered by acids and minerality, so the overall impression is one of richness without excessive weight rather than sugary sweetness.",Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2009 Berncasteler Doctor Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"A real bruiser of a Zinfandel, dark in color, dry and tannic, brimming with massive flavors of wild blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and pie spices. The tannins are hard, in the way of this mountain. Drink Now–2013 before it loses fresh fruit.",Elyse 2007 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain)
"A blend of Roussanne, Marsanne and Viognier, this was made in the passito style—grapes were dried to concentrate sugars, then pressed and fermented. The result is a terrific and unusual dessert wine, with candied fruits mixing papaya, guava, banana, Meyer lemon and more. The center is simply lush and fruity; the finish tails off gently with a honeyed kiss.",Francis Tannahill 2008 Passito White (Oregon)
"Smooth as silk, all estate-grown, this classy Pinot lists five Dijon clones, Pommard, Wadenswil and “Suitcase clone La Tache” on its tech sheet. Vibrant and spicy, with cherries galore (sounds like a James Bond heroine) and a round, full, lush and satisfying mouthfeel. This is the one to drink now, while you cellar the Cuvée Giselle.",Lachini 2008 Lachini Family Estate Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Named for a beautifully restored castle and boutique hotel in Abruzzo, this beautiful Italian white (made with Trebbiano grapes) shows a delicious creamy texture with abundant aromas of stone fruit, honey and toasted almond. The wine is thick and textured on the close.",Masciarelli 2007 Castello di Semivicoli  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo)
"A nice, everyday Pinot, with a properly silky texture. The cherry, cola, red licorice and bacon flavors are satisfyingly rich, with elaborate oak overtones. It's a pretty good value in an under-$20 Pinot Noir.",Castle Rock 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Somewhat hard-edged wine, showing the sharpness of young Chenin Blanc. It has a future, though, as this edge drops away, because there is some good weight as well as bright fresh final acidity. Keep for several months.",Château Moncontour NV Brut Chenin Blanc-Chardonnay (Crémant de Loire)
"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",Derbes 2006 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.",Frog's Leap 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford)
"Juicy and extracted, with bright jam tones and an open-knit structure. There's plenty of berry fruit here and a nice plum tone to the palate that carries over to the fleeting finish. A good choice for a big crowd.",Hellbent 2008 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)
"At 2.3% residual sugar, this is nicely balanced between sweet and dry. The fruit links peach, apricot and pear with a honey in tea streak that carries into the finish.",Washington Hills 2008 Riesling (Washington)
"Great nutty aromas come from the glass and follow into the palate of this sweeter style of white Port. It is rich, packed with almonds and a tangy orange zest edge.",Ramos-Pinto NV White Reserva  (Port)
"Here's a light and refreshing Rosso di Montalcino with sharp notes of berry, cherry, wet earth and violets. You'll also get some distant mineral tones that add dimension and personality. Pair this easy-drinking wine with your favorite home-cooked pasta dishes.",Sesti 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.",Tagaris 2007 Frank Chiullino Chef Blend Red Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous. The palate is well balanced and the flavors run sweet, ripe and chewy, with berry fruit and creamy licorice notes on the finish. A blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Garnacha from Catalonia.",Las Colinas Del Ebro 2008 Syrah-Grenache (Terra Alta)
"A solid value, the Marquee Victoria Chardonnay has an appealing restraint, hitting pretty high notes on the nose but turning serious and weighty in the mouth. The cream and papaya flavors reach a nice intensity before fading to a mouthwatering finish of guava and pine nuts. Drink now.",Marquee 2008 Classic Chardonnay (Victoria)
"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side. Flavors of baked berry, earth, caramel and coffee ring true, and the dry, toffee-tinged finish is a nice ending. Ready to go now.",Anciano 2003 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",Avery Lane 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
"A nice, rich Sauvignon Blanc for drinking now with lots of different kinds of foods. With some new oak, it has fruity-sweet flavors of limes, Meyer lemons, apricots and lemongrass, with a tang of gooseberry.",Beltane Ranch 2009 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Bodegas Docampo 2008 Viña do Campo White (Ribeiro)
"A fresh-faced wine, bright with berry fruits, a light layer of tannins and a soft, easy texture. There is some stalkiness but this is great as a delicious, easy wine.",Cortes de Cima 2009 Chaminé Red (Alentejano)
"Rich in berry, cherry, cola, pepper and sandalwood flavors, but a bit off in texture. Feels jagged and angular, with some green tannins. Ready now.",Crane Brothers 2006 Crane Ranch Vineyard Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",De Loach 2008 Cool Coastal Vineyards Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Showing pure tropical fruits with a squeeze of lemon, this is a ripe, tasty wine, maybe a little short on acidity, but bringing out ripe lychee and mango flavors.",Domaine Henry Pellé 2008 Les Bornés  (Menetou-Salon)
"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.",El Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Showing the hard tannins and dryness of a young Petite Sirah, this is the kind of wine you normally would cellar. But there's a little streak of green unripeness that suggests aging will lead nowhere. So drink it now with big, lusty fare.",Enkidu 2006 Fazekas Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.",Valle de Salinas 2008 Roble Red (Yecla)
"A very nice, likeable and super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc, at an everyday price. Nicely crisp and just slightly sweet, it shows fruity flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, pears and melons.",Villa San Juliette 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles)
"Barrel-fermented in neutral wood, this gives a quick whiff of buttered croissant, then dives into a moderately ripe palate with lime, pineapple and lemon rind. It's an all-purpose and appealing wine that is drinking nicely right now.",Plaisance Ranch 2014 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Applegate Valley)
"This opens with aromas of hay, pressed yellow flower and orchard fruit. The direct palate offers yellow apple skin, toasted nut and a mineral note alongside invigorating acidity.",Poggiobello 2014 Pinot Grigio (Friuli Colli Orientali)
"Closed and youthful, this wine is medium in build and subtle in oak. It conveys a briny streak throughout the palate, and a distinct taste of candied lemon.",Previous 2013 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Gold with copper hues, this opens with aromas of wildflower, tangerine zest and a whiff of crushed stone. The vibrant palate offers rennet apple, lime, ginger drop and a hint of mineral alongside mouthwatering acidity.",Primosic 2014 Santa Lucia Pinot Grigio (Collio)
Arinto is the real local grape of the small city of Bucelas where this quinta is located. This fresh wine shows its light mineral and citrus character very well. It also brings out riper fruit flavors that fill it out and give it a rich character. The wine is ready to drink now.,Quinta da Romeira 2014 Prova Régia Arinto (Lisboa)
"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel.",Roche 2013 Barrel Select American Oak Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Grapefruit, mineral and freshly cut grass aromas lead the way. On the palate, brisk acidity supports pink grapefruit, tangerine and a mineral note.",Ronco dei Tassi 2014 Sauvignon (Collio)
"It's the delicious, clean, crisp fruit that's so good about this wine. It is bright with acidity and crisp apple flavors along with a lemon tang texture giving a fine bite. Stylish and fresh, it is a fine apéritif wine in style.",Sauvion NV Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire)
"Pear, white flower and crushed rock open on the nose. On the vibrant palate, a mineral note wraps around a core of crisp apple while bracing acidity provides the backbone.",St. Pauls 2014 Plotzner Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Intense aromas of pressed broom, dried herb, hay and a whiff of tomato vine come together in the glass. The palate is fresh but rather closed, eventually revealing yellow apple skin, mineral and a saline note.",La Rajade 2014 Friulano (Collio)
"Aromas of toasted nut, citrus and oak lead the nose. The linear, rather lean palate shows yellow apple skin, bitter almond and lime zest. A mineral note signals the finish.",La Tunella 2013 Col Livius Friulano (Friuli Colli Orientali)
"Fresh and fruity, this lively white offers aromas and flavors of green Anjou pear, Granny Smith apple and white peach. Zesty acidity gives it a crisp, tangy finish.",La Vis 2014 Ritratti Pinot Grigio (Trentino)
"Delicate varietal aromas of tomato vine, cut grass, citrus and yellow stone fruit come together on this lively wine. The linear palate offers green melon, juicy grapefruit and a hint of tangerine alongside zesty acidity.",La Vis 2014 Vigna Maso Tratta Sauvignon (Trentino)
"Rhubarb and cranberry fruit, along with a touch of red apple suggests minimal ripening. It's a tangy, pleasant wine, light and optimal for near-term drinking with simple poultry dishes.",Le Cadeau 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"A fresh, citrus flavored wine with attractive fruitiness and a crisp texture. There is a yeasty edge that should vanish and leave just fruit. Because it is mainly made from Chenin Blanc, there is a nutty, honeyed aftertaste.",Louis de Grenelle NV Platine Brut Sparkling (Crémant de Loire)
"Aromas of apple, spring flower, bread crust and crushed rock come together in the glass. The brisk palate offers unripe Kaiser pear, citrusy notes and mineral set against a backbone of racy acidity.",Manincor 2014 Eichorn Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige Terlano)
"This is a tangy, not entirely varietal wine that's dense in black tea and black fruit, with layers of tobacco and dried herb. Give it time in the glass to open.",Meadowcroft 2013 Cornerstone Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Pomegranate, dark plum and slate show on the simple nose of this appellation blend. The palate is light, with hints of strawberry and plum as well as pencil lead and mace. It's a great option for chilling a bit and drinking on the beach.",Mignanelli 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking.",Monteviejo 2013 Lindaflor Chardonnay (Uco Valley)
"The nose of this lively white is a combination of delicate aromas of wildflower and orchard fruit while the bright palate offers tart Granny Smith apple, tangerine and a hint of crushed stone. Vibrant acidity carries through to the crisp finish.",Nals Margreid 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Apple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.",Nisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)
"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.",Passaggio 2014 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This Bordeaux-style blend is 25% Merlot, the rest an even split between Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Stiff, tannic and earthy, it delivers robust flavors of herb and bark more than ripe fruit. With its assertive tannins, it should stand up well to a grilled tri-tip.",Plaisance Ranch 2013 Ranch Red (Applegate Valley)
"A juicy, fruity wine that is named after the Knights Templar who built a magnificent castle and convent in the local city of Tomar. It is fresh with red berry acidity and some perfumed tannins. It should be ready to drink soon, but wait until the end of 2016 for the best results.",Quinta do Cavalinho 2013 Templários Colheita Seleccionada Red (Tejo)
"Leather saddle wafts from the glass atop ripe cherry, blackberry jam and brown sugar. Tightly wound in tannin and oak, this wine becomes pleasantly juicy on the finish.",Rodney Strong 2013 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"The nose is a bit shy but reveals delicate scents of citrus and a whiff of peach blossom while the vibrant palate displays crisp apple, tangerine and a hint of steely mineral. Brisk acidity gives it a clean, refreshing finish.",Ronco Blanchis 2014 Ribolla Gialla (Collio)
"Lavender and lilac are just part of the floral bouquet that emerges from this wine, which also shows a blackberry vinaigrette element on the nose. Once sipped, it's like sucking on a purple-flower candy, with more lavender as well as plum and a pencil-lead edge that cuts through the palate.",Sarah's Vineyard 2011 Old Vine Zinfandel (Santa Clara Valley)
"Delicate but alluring scents of spring flower and orchard fruit lift out of the glass. The palate is linear and rather lean but still refreshing, offering pear, yellow apple and mineral alongside bracing acidity. It closes crisp and clean.",St. Pauls 2014 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Fresh and lively, this opens with aromas of jasmine, tropical fruit and a whiff of flint. The vibrant palate offers crunchy Granny Smith and candied lemon alongside brisk acidity. A mineral note energizes the crisp finish.",Tenuta di Angoris 2014 Pinot Grigio (Collio)
"This is a thick, rich and very ripe wine, with a charred back note making its way against higher-toned tastes of red raspberry and blackberry. The oak is integrated and the wine softly varietal, but it packs a punch on the palate.",Buena Vista 2013 Attila's Selection Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste.",Don Cristobal 1492 2010 1492 Red (Mendoza)
"Tomato leaf, rhubarb and herbal aromas come in front of a tight, tannic and prickly palate with green, spicy berry flavors. Turns hot and smacky on the finish, with carob and herbal flavors.",Finca El Origen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Pretty good for the price, with jammy cherry, berry, cocoa and spice flavors. An easy Zin to drink with BBQ or pasta with tomato sauce.",Glen Ellen 2009 Old Vine Zinfandel (California)
"A heavy, sweet Zin. With 16% alcohol, it tastes like a simple Port, with raisin, blackberry and chocolate flavors.",Manzanita Creek 2005 Carreras Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Salinic and minerally on the nose, with a hint of peach. The palate is wet and light, however the flavors run stalky and tart, with green banana and bitterness leading to a chalky finish. Quaffable.",Montepio 2010 Pinot Gris (San Juan)
"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red.",Notro 2010 Tinto Fundación Red (Mendoza)
"Salmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.",Ochoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)
"Overtly sweet, with a white sugar edge to the citrus fruits, this is basically a dessert wine. Earns extra credit for cleanness and crisp acidity.",Robert Mondavi 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.,Starmont 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Light red wine, with a stalky black currant character. It is very fruity, showing herbs and soft tannins. Almost an apéritif red, certainly one for lightly flavored dishes.",Aveleda 2010 Casal Garcia Tinto Red (Portuguese Table Wine)
"This blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre is unbalanced. It's sweet in dessert red berry fruit, with an awkward streak of acidity.",Brophy Clark 2009 G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff.",Caligiore 2008 Organic Legacy Old Vines Malbec (Mendoza)
"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.",Caligiore 2010 Pianissimo Rosé (Mendoza)
"Funky with prune and tobacco overwhelming any fresher fruit, this Livermore Zin is high in alcohol (15.8%), which coats the tongue for a long time after the wine goes down.",Cedar Mountain 2007 Hansen Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"Simple and sweet, with jammy pineapple, orange and apricot flavors leading to a soft, honeyed finish.",Concannon 2010 Selected Vineyards Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"Sweet red plum aromas are candied and jumbled. The wine is clacky in the mouth, with a lot of acidity and narrow, sweet cherry flavors. Shows heat and burn on the finish. 50% Tempranillo-50% Merlot.",Solar de Urbezo 2010 Dance Del Mar Tempranillo-Merlot (Cariñena)
"A soft Vinho Verde, with white fruit flavors, only light acidity and some final sweetness. An attractive apéritif.",Wines & Winemakers 2010 Clemens Reserva White (Vinho Verde)
"A clumsy wine that aims for white Bordeaux in style and falls far short. There's plenty of oak and lees, but the underlying wine is thin and disappointing in citrus flavor.",Cosentino 2008 The Novelist Meritage (California)
"Earthy and tealike, with those attributes framed by charred, nutty oak. It's supple enough to be balanced for immediate consumption.",De Bortoli 2009 Deen De Bortoli Vat 10 Pinot Noir (South Eastern Australia)
"Soft, sweet raspberry fruit-flavored wine. It has a line of acidity while its main character is the light, sweet aftertaste. Screwcap.",DFJ Vinhos 2010 Coreto Rosé (Lisboa)
"Yellow Tail's sparkler is an aromatic blend of Semillon, Traminer, Viognier and Trebbiano that manages to be largely neutral on the palate at the same time it's perfumed on the nose. Frothy and off dry.",Yellow Tail NV Bubbles Sparkling White Wine Sparkling (South Eastern Australia)
"On the dry side, with caramel and strawberry flavors, this is an attractive, bright rosé, as fresh as they come.",Adega Cooperativa Ponte de Barca 2010 Escolha Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Smells earthy and leathery, with a grilled meat element to the nose. The palate runs sharp and high in acid, with narrow plum flavors. Doesn't offer a whole lot on the finish. More rubbery and tart than ideal.",Pasaje Alto 2010 Andes Crossing Malbec (Mendoza)
"Herbal and green peppercornish, with dark berry flavors and herbal-vegetal notes. Light and crisp; complex for the price.",De Bortoli 2008 DB Family Selection Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"Starts out with leather and cheesy aromas, and beyond that there's not a lot of fruit on the bouquet. It's a chunky, heavy wine with thick, jammy plum flavors that have strong herbal undertones. Warm, grabby and baked on the finish, which is plodding.",Figaro 2009 Tinto Red (Calatayud)
"This is a less formal Vin Santo. The wine is creamy and thick, with sweet syrupy notes of chestnut, honey, maple, candied fruit and dried apricot.",Fattoria di Casalbosco 2006 500ml  (Vin Santo del Chianti)
"Dominated by its dry tannins, this is a tight black currant and dark plum skin-flavored wine, surrounded by a firm core of tannins, a firm and dark-hued wine.",Georges Duboeuf 2009 Clos des Garands  (Fleurie)
"There is great structure here, with dusty tannins percolating through the rich wine. It has power, concentration and density, with cocoa and cherry flavors well integrated. Think about aging for 1–2 years.",Georges Duboeuf 2009 Sélection  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"This weirdly named wine is a blend of 95% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot. It's a bit soft and melted in texture, like liquid licorice, with flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, anise and smoky oak, and the finish is dry. Notable for the elegance and purity of its tannin structure.",Jarvis 2008 Will Jarvis' Science Project Red (Napa Valley)
"Big, dark and brash, and very much in the modern California style, meaning it's rich, creamy, oaky and full-bodied. The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012.",Kingston Family 2008 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Opens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.",Lapostolle 2007 Cuvée Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"The latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Grüner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.",Syncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.",Trapiche 2008 Broquel Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Pure, perfumed wine, its floral currant flavored fruit dancing in the glass. There is a bright lift to this delicious fruity wine, just demanding to be drunk. Screw cap.",Loimer 2009 Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"A solid, dense wine, packed with tannins and with a dry core. The soft fruit has flavors of strawberry, hinting at richness to come. At this early stage, tannins and acidity are still forming. Hold for five years.",Louis Latour 2008 Les Beaumonts Premier Cru  (Vosne-Romanée)
"There is a voluptuous edge to this generous wine. It has rich flavors, some strawberry and plum juice. The final extreme freshness shows through the layer of firm tannins. For aging over 4–5 years.",Louis Latour 2008 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)
"Made from the winery's little vineyard on Atlas Peak, this 100% Cabernet needs time to come around. It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.",M by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A Châteauneuf-du-Pape-style Rhône blend that really nails it for satisfaction. Rich and fruity, spicy, yet with great structure. Defines the vintner's art of blending, comprised of five varieties sourced from a dozen vineyards. Fun and serious at the same time.",Margerum 2007 M5 Red (Santa Barbara County)
"This is a great value in a Petite Sirah that shows how well the variety performs in a great vintage in a warmer climate. With 20% Syrah, which seems to add richness and nobility, the wine is bone dry and elegant in mouthfeel, with complex blackberry, black currant, grilled beef, black pepper and cedar flavors. Drink now.",Pedroncelli 2007 Family Vineyards Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"This 60-40 blend of Trebbiano Toscano and Malvasia Bianca offers a traditional interpretation with thick sweetness and aromas of roasted chestnut, caramel and honey.",Pietro Beconcini 1999 Caratello  (Vin Santo del Chianti)
"This is a robust and firmly structured Syrah with medium-coarse tannins and medium-full weight. Meaty and dark with notes of licorice, black currant, sweet spice and a touch of cocoa on the finish. Though it's intense, it still feels like it's holding back a little bit; try after 2012 for a more forward presentation.",Boekenhoutskloof 2007 Syrah (Coastal Region)
"The Cartizze cru is known as the best area for growing quality grapes for Prosecco. This precious expression shows drying mineral tones backed by sweet fruit, melon and peach. The soft, creamy quality if the perlage is also noteworthy.",Bortolotti NV Cartizze Dry  (Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze)
"Big, structured and solid, with powerful dense fruit, this is packed with plum juice flavors. The wine feels chunky, while the acidity keeps everything in proportion.",Chanson Père et Fils 2007  Gevrey-Chambertin
"With hints of mint, and a firm structure from wood as well as tannins, this is a flattering wine. The tannins are rich, layered within the jammy black berry fruits. This is a wine for aging, but is deceptively attractive now.",Château Cambon la Pelouse 2008  Haut-Médoc
"Since the futures tasting in 2009, the wood element has been tamed. It is still an important factor, but the fruit has blossomed, showing a solid core of tannins, surrounded by dark plum and red fruit flavors. It will need many years, but everything is here now.",Château Lilian Ladouys 2008  Saint-Estèphe
"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‘05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",Corison 2006 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper.",Longboard 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"If more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it. Beautifully ripe and soft, pure and rich in cherry and raspberry liqueur, smoke and pepper flavors. Ready now.",Margerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Inky dark in appearance and concentration, this muscular Recioto della Valpolicella Classico wraps your tongue tight with its blockbuster power and persistency. Aromas include blackberry jelly, chocolate, cola and exotic spice. It finishes with smooth firmness and loads of personality.",Nicolis 2006 500ml  (Recioto della Valpolicella Classico)
"A pleasant wine that shows a sweet, spicy apricot nose; on the palate it has an interesting smokiness that works well with the fruit, and although there is a fair amount of alcohol, the fruit just manages to cover it, and the wine moves to a pleasant if not particularly long finish.",Giacomo Ascheri 2006 Cristina Ascheri  (Gavi di Gavi)
"A lightweight Sauvignon Blanc that fits the standard Marlborough profile, with slightly grassy notes layered over grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",Saint Clair 2007 Vicar's Choice Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads.",Covey Run 2005 Quail Series Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.",Bearboat 2004 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Thickly textured and rather sweet, with superripe apples and pears that at times seem almost drenched in honey. Probably best on its own, well-chilled as a hot-weather apéritif.",Spy Valley 2006 Pinot Gris (Marlborough)
"Big, bold and soft, this is way too heavy. Sure, the Grüner spice is all there, but it is at the expense of a fresh, racy character. The toast character doesn't quite work either.",Jurtschitsch 2006 Schenkenbichl Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice. On the finish it is a touch stemmy, but it is so slight that it adds an exotic edge to the wine. Pleasant, not very intense and easy to like.",Valdinera 2005  Barbera d'Alba Superiore
"This is a heavy, bitterly tannic young wine that shows ripe blackberry and coffee flavors and spices. The raw astringency makes it tough now, fit only for greasy foods like barbecued ribs. It should age well for a long time, but will never quite overcome its rustic profile.",X 2005 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"The Ratti proved to be a rich, pleasant, gentle wine, showing lots of plummy fruit, not much acidity and a medium finish. The wine will marry well with a variety of foods, thanks to its hefty texture and its easygoing personality.",Renato Ratti 2004 Villa Pattono Red (Monferrato)
"Chiarlo tends to be one of the more reliable producers in Piedmont, and this comes across as a pleasant everyday wine. The fruit is very ripe, bordering on the superripe; but on the palate, the wine has some interesting flavors, dark cherry fruit and hints of licorice and green olive.",Michele Chiarlo 2005 Le Monache Red (Monferrato)
"The Pertinace offers a a soft, spicy nose of blackberry jam, vanilla and cinnamon. A pleasant, everyday, food-friendly wine that can be drunk now but has the structure to improve for a year or so. Imported by MW Imports.",Pertinace 2006  Dolcetto d'Alba
"The Pertinace evolved nicely in the glass; at first there are simple lime peel aromas, but over time, they become richer and slightly more complex. On the palate there is pear, as well as the lime and an interesting smoky quality. Crisp and with good balance, the finish is a little short. Imported by MW Imports.",Pertinace 2006  Roero Arneis
"The Einaudi is a fairly hefty version of a Dolcetto, having lost some fruit but gaining an interesting earthy character to the palate. Structurally a little on the chunkier side, but with good concentration. The finish is solid but dominated by the earthiness. Should be drunk soon.",Poderi Luigi Einaudi 2004  Dolcetto di Dogliani
"This is very soft upon entry, with remnants of penetrating spicy and herbal flavors that might have punched up the intensity if they hadn't been somehow smoothed over. It's difficult to assess, because many of the right pieces are all here, but somehow they have not jelled. The wine tastes acidic and sharp, with pineapple and citrus dominating, and a chalky, tannic finish. Perhaps it's just a matter of time?",Seia 2005 Alder Creek Vineyard Syrah (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This Rhône blend is soft and sugary sweet, with a honeyed, vanilla fudge and smoky oak edge. The underlying wine flavors are of peaches, pineapples and yellow apricots.",Kindred 2005 Marsanne-Roussanne-Viognier White (Russian River Valley)
"Like its vintage predecessors, this seems to have some residual sugar, which gives a honeyed sweetness to the peach, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. But it has a very crisp, pleasant acidity that keeps the wine lively.",Maddalena 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Paso Robles)
"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",Beringer 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.",Familia Schroeder 2006 Deseado Torrontés (Neuquén)
"Very laid back, the nose shows some mango and pear, but you really have to go looking for them. In contrast, the palate is almost pushy–this is a big, fat intense wine. Essentially quite simple, but very tasty. Short to medium finish.",Il Falchetto 2006 Tenuta Del Fant  (Moscato d'Asti)
"Flighty and delicate on the palate, this refreshingly mineral semi-sweet wine is juicy with sweet apple flavor accented with brisk lime acidity. Hints of honey  and white flowers linger softly on the finish.",Red Newt Cellars 2012 Sawmill Creek Vineyards North Block Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up. The wine is lively, tough and offers bracing acidity. Flavors of herbs, licorice and lemony acidity support core blackberry fruit, while the finish is herbal and woodsy, with dark notes of espresso and black licorice.",Señorío de Caleruega 2009  Ribera del Duero
"Delicate lavender and herb notes perfume this pretty off-dry wine. It's delicate in profile, but flavors of tart yellow stone fruit and blossom gain intensity on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity. It concludes with a refreshing mineral tone.",Silver Thread 2012 Semi-dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
Minerally black plum and boysenberry aromas set up a rubbery palate with medium weight and intensity. Generic but happy flavors of blackberry and cassis finish with dry spice and rubbery notes  as well as length and freshness.,Telmo Rodríguez 2012 g Dehesa Gago  (Toro)
"Precise yellow grapefruit, currant bud and apricot notes lead onto the medium-bodied, zesty palate. The grapefruit note remains dominant on the palate, and the lively acids give it a vibrant edge.",Breaux 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Virginia)
"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents. This feels healthy and balanced, with flavors of herbal berry and currant. Things turn a bit saucy and more herbal on the finish.",Chakras 2009 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak.",Chalk Hill 2012 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Chalk Hill)
"A fruity wine, it shows ripe red berries, red currants and refreshing acidity. So while the wine has weight, it is also totally fresh and crisp. It's a rosé for food, rich while balanced.",Château Henri Bonnaud 2013 Terre Promise Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"Very salmon pink in color, this lively, crisp wine has some weight as well as refreshing fruit. It is full-bodied, with citrus and raspberry fruits, dry and very fresh at the end.",Château la Gordonne 2013 Verité du Terroir Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This bright wine reveals fragrances of white flower, pear, citrus and slate. The juicy palate offers grapefruit, lemon-lime and mineral. A succulent finish closes on a note of white almond.",Contrada Michele 2012 Selvecorte  (Fiano di Avellino)
"Salt air, lemon pith and lemon blossom lead in this 100% Malvasia Istriana. A wave of citrus and pronounced juicy grapefruit flavors refreshes the midpalate. The finish is zesty and lively.",Coronica 2012 Malvasia (Istria)
"Roughly half stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc and half barrel-fermented Sémillon, this has noticeable sweetness that puts a sugary edge on the flavors. Pineapple and Meyer lemon fruits are round and full-bodied. This should be chilled to cut down some of the sugary flavors.",Covington 2012 Klipsun Vineyard Blanc Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Red Mountain)
"Fresh floral and apple notes are showered with zesty lime and lemon on the nose of this bright, invigorating wine. Dry and medium-bodied in style, the palate boasts hints of freshly cut grass and green apples that lend an herbaceous touch to concentrated grapefruit flavors.",Dr. Konstantin Frank 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"A savory wine, it features aromas of lemon zest, stone fruit and hazelnuts. The palate offers lemon-lime, pear and pink grapefruit accented with mineral and an almond note.",Fattoria La Rivolta 2012 Greco (Sannio)
"Bright, playful berry and plum aromas are clean and fruity. Fresh and juicy, it shows firm but not jagged acidity. Flavors of ripe plum, berry, cocoa powder and herbs finish in forward fashion and not too oaky.",Argento 2012 Bonarda (Mendoza)
"There's a lush, decadent edge to this wine, thanks to heady aromas of vanilla cream, chocolate-covered raspberry and boysenberry preserves. The palate shows more restraint, with textured, fruit-skin flavors of plum and cherry that finish slightly chewy. Enjoy this now.",Beau Joubert 2009 The Ambassador Red (Stellenbosch)
"The aromas are surprisingly light for the variety with notes of ripe pear and peach. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors and a rounded, creamy feel leading to a warm finish.",Jones of Washington 2013 Viognier (Wahluke Slope)
"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",Ken Wright 2011 Celilo Chardonnay (Washington)
"For a wine with such a large volume (over half a million cases were imported to the U.S.), the quality is admirable. Passion fruit and grapefruit elements dominate, while some grassier notes emerge as the wine sits in the glass, resulting in a pleasant blend of tropical and herbal notes. It's plump on the midpalate, then gains focus on the lengthy, mouthwatering finish.",Kim Crawford 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Dusty, yeasty aromas of red apple skins, cherry and chocolate lead to a solid and true palate with a good bubble bead, moderate elegance and full flavors of plum, red apple, cherry and spice. This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.",Llopart 2010 Brut Reserva Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",Maimai 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Hawke's Bay)
"Polished and sleek, this wine opens with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. The steely palate offers grapefruit, lemon zest and nectarine alongside energizing mineral and fresh acidity. It has a clean, refreshing finish.",Masseria Felicia 2012 Anthologia Falanghina (Falerno del Massico)

"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay.",Nickel & Nickel 2012 Stiling Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.",Niner 2010 Fog Catcher Red (Paso Robles)
"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",Novelty Hill 2011 Stillwater Creek Vineyard Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))
"With minerally, clean aromas of lemon-lime and seashell, this is ready for summer sipping. A tangy, citric palate offers pure orange, tangerine and lime flavors, with mango thrown in for moderate sweetness.

Drink now.",Raats Family 2012 Original Unwooded Chenin Blanc (Coastal Region)
"Sultry, smoky oak accents the ripe fruit core, full of apricot, peach and pear aromas and flavors.

Drink now–2016.",Radford Dale 2012 The Renaissance of Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)

"A blend of vines grown on granite and richer gabbro soils, this is a full wine, with creamy white fruits and acidity that is fully integrated into the smooth texture. Crispness comes through at the end to give a bright aftertaste with plenty of acidity.",Domaine des Cognettes 2014 Les 2 Terres Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"The wine is ripe, balanced and likely to be ready to drink soon. With its plump fruitiness and texture, it is a full wine. Rich red-berry fruits are gently balanced by acidity and supported with a light layer of tannins. It will be very drinkable from late 2017.",Domaine Julie Belland 2014 Charmes  (Santenay)
"The wine comes from the highest point of the slope above Santenay, giving it an attractive cool and crisp character. With its delicious, refreshing acidity as well as ripe pear flavors it is balanced, minerally and with fine acidity. The aftertaste confirms that the wine is ready to drink.",Domaine Julie Belland 2014 Comme Dessus  (Santenay)

"Dark cherry, herb and medicine cabinet notes lead to bright cherry flavors. The tannins provide some chew.",Trust 2013 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Sultry vanilla, smoke and bergamot notes thread languorously on the nose of this intensely perfumed Chardonnay. The palate is more subdued, showing zesty red apple and lemon anchored by a crisp acidic backbone. It's a touch woody now but could balance out with a few more years of bottle aging.",Whitecliff Vineyard 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Hudson River Region)

"Yealands is based in the Awatere Valley, a subregion of Marlborough that offers generally cooler, later ripening than the main (Wairau) valley.

"Ripe earthy aromas of raisin and oaky vanilla open this heavy, saturated Tannat that displays jagged tartaric acidity and heat (15.5% ABV).

"Made from 85% Grenache and 15% Syrah, both from Kick Ranch Vineyard, this salmon-colored quaffer was fermented in concrete, and is hard to describe aromatically, taking its time to open. Dry, it tastes of watermelon and a hint of clove-like spice, remaining fresh on the palate and lightweight.",Kale 2014 Rosé (Sonoma County)

The finish is lengthy in vanilla and smoke.",Ty Caton 2012 EnTycement Red (Sonoma County)
"Like a genie released from the bottle, this wine rises up with aromas of violets, herbs, cranberry and bittersweet chocolate.

"While five years from harvest, this bold, penetrating Merlot is still a baby, with a long, promising future ahead. Subtle whiffs of crisp red cherry and mushroom seem quiet on the nose, but the palate is deeply concentrated. Black plum and cherry flavors are penetrating yet deftly grounded by a core of mouth puckering tannin and acidity. Enjoy starting 2020, but should maintain for much longer.",Waters Crest 2010 Grand Vin Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)

"A mix of fruity notes immediately hit: white currant, gooseberry, apple and citrus. The palate is slender and fizzes with those primary fruit flavors that have overtones of meadow flowers. This is frothy, refreshing and fun on the surface, but there is serious backbone and intent.",Ridgeview Estate 2011 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England)

"The Calico White is one of the state's most popular white blends, and is moving step by step toward an all-Rhône effort, now 44% Viognier 37% Roussanne, and just 19% Chardonnay. Winemaker Steffan Jorgensen deftly blends vineyards and AVAs to craft a refreshing, lightly-oaked wine with lime, lemon, pale peach and quinine.",Bergevin Lane 2008 Calico White White (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Dense, dark wine, with good black plum, fig, coffee and sweet raisin flavors. The ripe tannins fit well into this fruit mélange, with definite richness from new wood. There is good, juicy power here, as the wine finishes well with both dry tannin and fresh acidity.",Château Barreyres 2006  Haut-Médoc
"This is a thick, masculine Amarone with dense extraction and soda- like qualities of root beer, smoked bacon, A1 Steak Sauce and beef jerky. It delivers enormous power and concentration followed by a thick, meaty feel.",Tommasi 2004 Il Sestante Vigneto Monte Masua  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"VillaBella delivers a generous Amarone from the Classico zone with loads of spice and characteristic blackberry and cherry fruit. On the one hand, the wine tastes a bit overripe with strawberry marmalade. On the other, the firm tannins and natural freshness keep it in check. Age this wine another five years.",Vigneti Villabella 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"This is a nicely made Marlborough Sauvignon at an attractive price, with herbal, grassy notes and a touch of bell pepper backed by underlying tropical fruit. It's round without being soft, retaining sufficient crispness to serve alone or with seafood.",Wairau River 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Here's an austere Amarone with overripe notes of fruit preserve, blackberry jelly, moist tobacco, leather, spice and root beer. The wine backs dense concentration with amazing intensity of aromas. It's sweet and sour at the same time with firm tannins.",Le Ragose 2003  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Lots of juicy blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors in this dry, full-bodied young wine. But it's also very tannic, with a lockdown astringency. Seems to have the stuffing for more than six years in the cellar.",Martin Ranch 2005 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A lovely Syrah. With its touch of spicy bacon, it shows lush flavors of blackberries, black pepper and sandalwood, wrapped into firm but gentle tannins. Easy to drink with garlicky roast lamb.",Newsome-Harlow 2006 Syrah (Calaveras County)
"There's a lot of mature fruit and some strawberry jam here backed by prunes, raisins, tobacco, incense and cola. Pretty nuances of white stone and dried hay appear on the nose and the wine ends with sweet, sticky flavors of ripe berry.",Guerrieri Rizzardi 2003 Villa Rizzardi  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"A touch mossy and herbal on the nose, but also poised, balanced and inviting. The palate is juicy and incorporates good mouthfeel, and the flavors of spiced plum have character. Finishes with pepper and toast along with mild tannic bite. Imported by Great Wines Corpora U.S.",Porta 2007 Gran Reserva Syrah (Aconcagua Valley)
"A beautiful Sauvignon Blanc that does everything you want with this variety.

Really nice wine at a great price.",Ledgewood Creek 2007 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Suisun Valley)

"Probably the best wine from this producer that we've rated. It's meaty and rich, with mocha, crusty oak, aged cheese and kirsch aromas. The palate is juicy and balanced, with licorice, blackberry, blueberry and other dark, ripe flavors. Finishes lengthy and toasty, with some refinement. 1,500 cases made.",Cosme Palacio y Hermanos 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)
"Great wafts of white currants come from this delicious—but definitely too young—wine. It is full of flavor, fruity and ripe. There's a good structure from green apple skins and tight acidity. Give it another year.",Domaine Seguin 2007  Pouilly-Fumé
"The king of New York State Riesling pulls it off again. This wine opens with a gorgeous blend of mineral and fruit. The vibrant flavors follow through in the mouth with wet stones, apricot, pear and just a touch of slate. The long, elegant finish justifies every penny of the $18 price tag.",Dr. Konstantin Frank 2007 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A 10-year-old that tastes older than its indicated age. There is a strong wood-aged feel to it, the toast and vanilla from wood coming through well. It is also on the dry side, giving it spice rather than molasses. The finish is dense, concentrated.",Gilberts NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port)
"An elegant Port, its fruit and firm tannins blending effortlessly with blackberry jelly and spice flavors. It is halfway between a sweet and dry style, the sweetness coming from prunes, the dryness from firm tannins. This could probably age a few years in the bottle.",Poças 2001 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"This wine offers some meaty fruit flavors that gather round the midpalate and hold there; a big bundle of berries, cherries and plums, annotated with cinnamon and spice. There's even a hint of mint, and the slightest suggestion of fresh cilantro; the only off-note is a little gluey flavor in the finish.",Stoller 2006 SV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Toasty and vanilla-scented, with deeper, riper fruit than the Reserva and an extra layer of textural richness. It's plummy, chocolaty and slightly fudge-like in flavor.",Tarapaca 2007 Gran Reserva Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Lustau calls it dry but Los Arcos definitely has some aromatic and palate sweetness. The nose settles on brown sugar, peach, mixed nuts and honey. It's not super tight or acidic, and thus the palate drips maple and molasses. Medium-bodied and balanced, but with that shot of sugar offset by honest but mellow acids.",Lustau NV Dry Amontillado Los Arcos Sherry (Jerez)
"Here's a Conero Riserva from the estate's San Lorenzo vineyard that holds back nicely in terms of its aromatic intensity and delivers a drinkable, elegant experience instead. The mouthfeel is clean and polished with sweet cherry flavors backed by Asian spice.",Umani Ronchi 2004 Cúmaro Riserva  (Conero)
"Grown in the Sebastopol Hills area, this Pinot tastes very young and jammy and immature. Released at less than a year of age, it's thick and a little heavy, with cherry, currant and mocha flavors not yet meshed with oak. One wonders why the winery didn't hold it back another year or so. But it could develop in the bottle. Try after 2010.",W.H. Smith 2007 Umino Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Lifted and juicy, this impressive effort from Western Australia shows woodsy, cedary notes on a restrained nose. The palate is drenched in gorgeous cassis and cherry cordial fruit framed by gentle tannins. The crisp finish will cut through steak or pork dishes. Imported by America Uncorked.",Watershed 2005 Awakening Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)
"There is such a surprising level of acidity in this wine that it seems unsure of where to go with its sweetness. The fruit flavors are lemon, peach and dry honey. While the wine is likely to age, it is already missing intensity.",Château Rabaud-Promis 2004  Sauternes
"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel-fermented Chardonnay, what some might label “naked” or “unwooded.” It is widely available and very appealing, with a tart, stony texture and bright, acid-driven fruit. Green apple and citrus are front and center in this vintage, with a steely spine of natural acid and virtually no residual sugar.",Chehalem 2007 INOX Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"Fragrant and soft, this nicely oaked Pinot Noir offers cherry, cola, mocha and toast flavors. If there is a critique to be made, it is that the finish, though clean and pure, feels just a little flat in the mouth, not as lively as the entry promises.",Daedalus Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A rich wine from a ripe year. The flavors are full and open, edged with a mushroom character that suggests maturity. The fruits are going towards almonds, while the structure has softened.",Fournier Père et Fils 2005 Grand Cuvée Fournier Vieilles Vignes  (Sancerre)
"Smells and tastes semisweet, with vanilla and molasses on the nose. The palate runs sweet as well, with root beer, brown sugar and brownie flavors.

"Coda della Foce (a blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Petit Verdot that sees 17 months in oak) delivers a sweet nose of cherry fruit, red rose, blueberry and Indian spice. The wine has firm density and raw tannins followed by succulent fruit flavors.",Cantine Barbera 2006 Coda della Foce Red (Menfi)
"Sachia is a pure expression of the Perricone grape variety that shares some similarities to modern Cabernet or Syrah. This is a meaty, full-bodied red with lingering tones of black pepper, sage leaf, smoke and toasted nut lavished over a solid core of cherry fruit. The wine offers thick tannins and firm structure suitable for beef dishes.",Caruso & Minini 2006 Terre di Giumara Sachia Perricone (Sicilia)
"Vanilla and fresh lumber notes lead the way, but gardenia and stone fruits emerge in the mouth and lead to a long, creamy finish remniscent of a peach milkshake. A final kick of acidity keeps the whole thing balanced.",Yangarra Estate Vineyard 2007 Single Vineyard Viognier (McLaren Vale)
"Usually one of Yarra's top Pinots, the 2006 YS Reserve is a medium-bodied, rounded wine with extremely soft tannic structure. The aromas hint at brown sugar, coffee and cola, with flavors of roasted root vegetables and a touch of mushroom. Supple and silky on the finish. Drink now.",Yering Station 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
"An initial blast of butter and sweaty cheese settles with airing, but this amontillado remains aggressive and demanding up front. In the mouth, this is correct in feel and balance. Saline-rich flavors of walnut, peanut and mushroom finish steady.",Alvear NV Amontillado Carlos VII Pedro Ximénez (Montilla-Moriles)
"Soft, round and lengthy, there's a lot to admire and enjoy in this wine. Licorice, leather and undulating ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit combine on the palate. It's medium bodied, intense and complex, with dark chocolate accents on the finish.",Ampelos 2012 Gamma Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Aromas of sweet oak and maple announce that this Mencía received generous barrel treatment. Supple in feel, this tastes of oaky plum and raspberry along with a dash of salt. Jammy berry notes and a hint of Graham cracker rise up on the finish. Drink through 2019.",Avancia 2014 Mencía (Valdeorras)

"From the warmest vintage on record, ripeness was never the issue here. It's balance and freshness that are the litmus test, and this passes with flying colors. Firm polished apple and pear fruit anchors the wine, with highlights of citrus skin. It's got all you could ask for in an all-purpose, solid and tasty young white wine.",Sokol Blosser 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This nonvintage blend is best identified by its edtion number—this latest being #20. It's a runaway success, cleverly incorporating up to eight different varieties. Mixing aromatic whites and fruit-powered grapes such as Chardonnay and Pinot Gris, it captures the best of both. Here the citrusy aromatics are principally from Muscat, while a touch of Sémillon adds a lick of lanolin to the tangy, juicy fruit.",Sokol Blosser NV Evolution Lucky No. 9 White (America)
"This is the best of the 2015 vineyard designates from Soléna. It's a pretty wine with bright raspberry fruit. There's a gentle touch of stem, which helps to frame it, and a dark vein of espresso and cacao running through the tannins.",Soléna 2015 Prince Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This wine is remarkably well made and memorable for its relatively large production scale, making it a great, accessible find. Integrated oak meets lifted acidity, the midpalate driven by floral and citrus highlights. The finish is light and refreshing.",Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"From a tiny coastal vineyard, this wine appears light-bodied and delicate at first, building its power slowly in the glass. Sous bois, earthy spice and savory tea give it an edginess unfettered by fruit, while a healthy tannic structure keeps it grounded.",Talisman 2013 Huckleberry's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Complex aromatics link notes of pine needle, chocolate cherry bark and pepper. In the mouth it's smooth and supple, graceful and polished. It finishes slightly chalky and citrusy. Drink up by 2020.",The Four Graces 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

"Very little Auxerrois is grown in Oregon, and the earliest plantings, the owners note, were here at Zenith. This could be mistaken for a Chardonnay, with ripe melon, peach and banana fruit matched to rounded out flavors of butter and caramel. It was barrel fermented and put through malolactic, much like a fine Chardonnay.",Zenith 2015 Auxerrois (Eola-Amity Hills)

"Jammy blackberry aromas come with strong notes of creosote and asphalt but not much nuance.

Drink through 2024.",Bosque De Matasnos 2012  Ribera del Duero
"Leather, underbrush, grilled herb and charred earth aromas take center stage, accented by a balsamic note.

Drink or hold a few more years.",Cantina del Giusto 2012 Baradiero  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano)

"Owned by the Borie family, one of the grand families of Bordeaux, the vineyard forms part of Château Fourcas-Borie. The wine, with its dark tannins and dense texture, is powerful and concentrated.

There is a juicy character that shines through the youthful structure. The wine will age well. Drink from 2019.",Château Lestruelle 2014  Médoc

A wine that cleans and stimulates the palate, and a welcome addition to the top tier.",Girard 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Ripe red raspberry fruit fills the nose; this seems more fruit forward than most other Klipsun designates.

"Perhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.",Gordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Crafted by Mark McNeilly (Mark Ryan winery), this pure Syrah was cellared in about one third new oak.

"This wine's tightly wound woodspice, black cherry, cocoa, caramel and herb aromas are followed by tart, plentiful dark fruit flavors.

Elderberry and elderflower show on the sip, as do beet juice, dried ginger, crushed rocks, potting soils and a concentrated potpourri of purple flowers.",Calera 2013 Jensen Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan)
"Multifaceted aromas of rose, iris, leather, cranberry, truffle and the barest hint of game lead the nose. The radiant palate offers creamy strawberry, ripe red cherry, orange zest, baking spice, dried herb and tobacco alongside firm but polished tannins. Fresh acidity provides balance while a mineral vein energizes the finish. With its smooth texture, it's already tempting but hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018–2026.",Giuseppe Rinaldi 2012 Brunate  (Barolo)
"The producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture. Pepper, clove and cardamom ride huge waves of baked fruit and mocha, with the structure to age through at least 2026, but why wait when it's so delicious now?",Donum 2013 Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"95   Massolino 2012 Parafada (Barolo). A textbook Barolo, this opens with scents of mature berry, leather, underbrush, tobacco and an elegant trace of fragrant blue flower. The well-structured palate delivers succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, licorice, clove and mineral alongside a backbone of firm yet refined tannins. Drink 2020–2030.",Massolino 2012 Parafada  (Barolo)
"This voluptuously seductive wine is also elegantly balanced. Citrus, wet stone and sea salt lift the minerality to pronounced levels, accented by a crispness of lemon peel and papaya wrapped in blossoming jasmine. Many of the vines on the site date back nearly 40 years, a demonstration that in age there is beauty.",Patz & Hall 2014 Dutton Ranch Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Bruised strawberries and ripe red plums are leveled by iron, ginger snaps, crushed slate and soy on the umami-laden nose of this bottling by Winemaker Jonathan Nagy. Intriguing river--stone minerality powers the palate, where black plums and olallieberries meet with black spice and lots of florality.",Byron 2013 Julia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"The appellation famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay packs a powerfully pretty punch when it comes to this variety, too, showing in this wine a soft, focused layering of Luxardo maraschino cherry and touch of cranberry. It then reveals an underlying richness that rewards the patient with a splash of white and black pepper, leaving an indelible stamp on the palate. Drink now through 2024.",Carlisle 2014 Saitone Ranch Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"The Grand Cru of Quarts de Chaume juts out over the Layon Valley, with its autumn mists, resulting in the best conditions for noble rot. This luscious wine, gold in color, is so rich, so intense as to be almost overwhelming. It is so young still all rich fruit, peaches, apricots with a touch of ginger. The wine, with its background of considerable acidity, will develop slowly; drink from 2020.",Château Pierre-Bise 2011 Grand Cru  (Quarts de Chaume)
"Crafted from 12 different clones planted throughout the estate vineyard, farmed to perfection, this is a delicious and exuberant expression of blueberry crumble that's succulent and inviting in every way. Full bodied, it retains enough acidity to remain mouthwatering and yet complex, a subtlety of white pepper and cardamom biting at the its heels. Drink now through 2024.",Wayfarer 2014 Wayfarer Vineyard Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"This is a beautiful display of Durell's greatness, crafted from two blocks of the vineyard, one planted to Old Wente, the other in one of the site's most rocky and windy areas. Combined, it offers well-integrated notions of golden apple, pear and honey amidst a freshness of acidity and unobtrusive oak, just the slightest suggestion of nutmeg-dusted brioche on the finish.",Three Sticks 2014 Durell Vineyard Origin Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Roberto Conterno didn't make his flagship Monfortino in this vintage so he blended the juice destined for this iconic wine into Francia. It opens with enticing aromas of dark berry, underbrush, baking spice, mineral and a balsamic note that carry over to the powerful palate, along with juicy raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's big and structured but also shows balance and complexity. Drink 2019–2029.",Giacomo Conterno 2011 Francia  (Barolo)
"Fragrant and loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of wild berry, blue flower, new leather, aromatic herb and a whiff of exotic spice. The structured, elegant palate delivers layers of red cherry, strawberry, flinty mineral, orange zest, star anise and clove framed in firm, polished tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and will develop even more complexity. Drink 2019–2029.",Biondi 2014 Contrada Monte San Nicolò  (Etna)
"This gorgeous wine opens with aromas of smoke, baking spice, red berry and flint. The mineral note carries over to the vibrant, silky palate, accenting juicy Morello cherry, white pepper, star anise, Mediterranean herb and tobacco. Polished tannins and fresh acidity provide impeccable balance. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2019–2027.",Biondi 2014 Outis Rosso  (Etna)
"Gavin Chanin is expert at showing off individual vineyards, which is most evident in this bottling from a less iconic, larger site. Baked cherry, allspice, raw beef and light bay leaf show on the nose, while the palate carries ripe strawberry and a red-cherry core surrounded by zesty thyme, dill, mint and a touch of green olive. The light yet grippy texture is stunning.",Chanin 2014 Los Alamos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"From the appellation that is at a summit of Loire sweet wines, this golden wine balances intense acidity with intense botrytis and honey flavors. Ripe peaches and pineapples dominate the fruit profile of this concentrated, beautiful wine. It is just approaching its peak, so wait a little longer, until 2018.",Château de Fesles 2011 Vin Rare  (Bonnezeaux)
"Radiant and earthy, this blend of Frappato and Nero d'Avola boasts enticing scents suggesting dark-skinned berry, leather, sunbaked earth, sea breeze and a floral note. The creamy, succulent palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and aromatic herb alongside supple tannins and fresh acidity. A saline note wraps up the finish. Drink 2017–2024.",COS 2014 Pithos Rosso Red (Vittoria)
"Scratchy, earthy aromas of red plum and cherry lead to a bland palate with modest raspberry and red plum flavors. This closes with dried-out red-fruit notes and little else.",Aguirre 2011 Reina Ana Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Central Valley)
"Tasting quite sweet and soft, like a raspberry liqueur, this high-alcohol Zinfandel is wrapped in vanilla and cinnamon tones and would be difficult to pair with anything beyond barbecue.",Wood Family Vineyards 2010 Muy Bueno Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"This blend is based on Grenache. It has white sugar, raspberry, caramel and spice flavors that finish as luscious as a candy bar.",Kaleidos 2008 Osiris Red (Paso Robles)
"This variety is one of the traditional Port grapes. It should do well as a dry wine in the hotter areas of California, but no one has figured out how to make it happen. This bottling by Kenneth Voik does not advance the cause. The wine is heavy and dull.",Kenneth Volk 2010 Pomar Junction Vineyard Touriga Nacional (Paso Robles)
"This barrel-fermented rosé is flat and smells more like apple juice than wine. Despite showing some tang, this is dull in the mouth, with bland orange and nectarine flavors. On the finish, it's washed out and has an iodine-like aftertaste.",Finca Albret 2011 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)
"Simple and tasting of vanilla toffee, this Chardonnay, value-priced for sure, has a finish that's puckeringly sweet.","Truett Hurst 2011 Eden Ridge, Barrel Select Chardonnay (Mendocino County)"
"Light and watery, this boxed Sauvignon Blanc offers simple fruit with some mineral and citrus at the back. There's not much here, but the freshness is nice.",Cara Mia NV Sauvignon Blanc (Delle Venezie)
"Soft and dull, with green pea, peach jam and buttered toast flavors that finish a little sugary.",Materra Cunat Family Vineyards 2011 Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)
"Tastes a little vegetal and simple, with cherry jam, asparagus and sweet oak flavors. Not a success, and a particular disappointment compared to the winery's other 2010 single-vineyard Pinots.",Gary Farrell 2010 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"This is a pretty ordinary Pinot Noir that's dry and brisk in acidity, with thinned-down cherry skin, pomegranate and cola flavors. Loses a point for some bitterness in the finish.",Hess Select 2010 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Soft, rich and simple, with flavors of lemondrop candy and vanilla.",Pedroncelli 2012 friends.white White (Sonoma County)
"Part of the natural wine movement, this frizzy Lambrusco opens with a dark raspberry color and easy aromas of cassis, sour cherry and chopped mint. The foamy close is easy and thin.",Quarticello NV Ferrando  (Lambrusco dell'Emilia)
"A simple Pinot, with Beaujolais-like bubble gum and raspberry-jam flavors. Finishes ripe and a bit sugary.",Six Degrees 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"Whatever the varieties are on this wine, and it's not disclosed, it's soft, ripe and simple, with orange, peach and lime flavors.",Austerity 2011 White (California)
"Bordeaux Claret has a darker color than a rosé, suggesting more weight. This wine, though, also has a green herbal edge that is less attractive.",Château de Piote 2012 Red (Bordeaux Clairet)
Assiolo is a slightly tart and bitter expression of Sangiovese with sharp aromas of cherry fruit and plum. The tannins show an astringent and nervous quality.,Costa Archi 2010 Assiolo  (Sangiovese di Romagna Superiore)
"Earthy and very tight after aging 20 months in barrel and another two years in bottle prior to release, this wine's fruit is slipping away, leaving behind only a pruney sourness.",Amador Cellars 2006 Westside Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Made from organic grapes, Green Truck's Petite has not a lot going on aromatically and exhibits very little in the way of the variety's profile, tasting like generic red wine.",Green Truck 2010 Petite Sirah (Mendocino County)
"Way too ripe, with the flavors veering into raisins. The alcohol, which is 15.6% abv, really sticks out.",Brochelle Vineyards 2010 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Intensely acidic wine, its red fruits and caramel hidden behind a tart, over-lemoned flavor. For lovers of mouth-shockingly dry rosé. Screwcap.",Château Larroque 2012 Red (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Rubbery, mulchy aromas never clean up and rank as rough. Roughness describes the palate, too, while flavors of herbal fruit, bitterness, hard spices and buttery oak fail to come around.",Cornellana 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley)
"A very basic Cabernet Sauvignon, very low in alcohol, with a harshness on the finish.",Harlow Ridge 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This bargain-priced wine is oaky and bland, with a smell of menthol.",Harlow Ridge 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"A Lake County SB with very little in the way of aromatics. It's acceptable for everyday, but a generic white wine.",Green Truck 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"This is no longer in its prime. It tastes weird, mealy and slightly exotic, while the palate feels rubbery. Nectarine and plum notes are detectable on a strained finish.",Dominio de Eguren 2011 Protocolo Rosé (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Soft, dull and vegetal. Still, it's drinkable for some modest cola flavors and velvety mouthfeel.",Vinum 2010 Pinot Noir (California)
"This is edgy and lean, with mulch and latex on a stripped back nose. In the mouth, it clangs around due to racy acidity. Flavors of leafy red fruits and citrus are not fully convincing.",William Cole 2011 Albamar Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"This reedy, strained Garnacha features cheesy aromas, stalky fruit and chemical notes. The palate is hard in feel, with a weedy, burnt aftertaste.",Bodegas 1898 2009 Ramón Roqueta Garnacha (Catalunya)
"There's a thorny, almost raw quality of fruit here that is backed by a touch of dill weed and black tar. It feels tart and slightly bitter on the close.",Fattoria Giuseppe Savini 2011 Rondineto Merlot (Colli Aprutini)
"With dusty, candied aromas, the bouquet on this semisweet Cava is scattered all over the map. In the mouth, it's inoffensive, however the wine's candied, melony flavors are cloying and overtly sugary. This is too clumsy and candied to be taken seriously.",Paul Cheneau NV Demi Sec Sparkling (Cava)
"Dry lime and citrus peel aromas are round and solid, nothing more. That more or less describes the palate, which tastes a little bit wheaty and dull, with a note of bitter melon on the finish. Drink now.",Eguren 2015 Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
This wine offers very ripe fruit that gives an almost-sweet character to what should be a dry wine. There is acidity that helps. Drink now.,Quinta do Castelinho 2013 Quinta Dona Mafalda Vinhas Velhas Red (Douro)
"This single vineyard cuvée is quite light, yet retains your interest with a thin dusting of cocoa and ground coffee around the tangy berry fruit. It's a bit earthy, but a pleasant quaffer, along the lines of a generic Bourgogne.",Rock Point 2014 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This is an easy, fruity wine. Soft and light in character, it has attractive red fruits and acidity. Drink this wine now.",Jose Maria Vieira 2014 Borges Quinta da Soalheira Red (Douro)
This soft wine has muted red fruits and light acidity. Drink now.,Kopke 2013 Reserva Red (Douro)
"The wine is rich and ready to drink. With red fruits and warm tannins, it is a ripe wine that has a light structure and balanced acidity. It is already an easy wine—fruity and soft at the end.",Les Vignerons Réunis de Monségur 2014 Château Tuilerie Pagès  (Bordeaux)
"The nose on this bottling is classic for the grape: blackberry, dried lilacs, wet asphalt, beef char and black rocks. The palate is more muddled, with flavors of clay and freshly turned earth, without much spice or fruit to note.",Martin Ranch 2013 Thérèse Vineyards Dos Niñas Vineyard Syrah (Santa Clara Valley)
"The wine was aged in 30% new American oak, and has modest cherry fruit with astringent tannins. There's an underlying earthy flavor, leading into a chalky finish.",Weisinger 2013 Estate Tempranillo (Rogue Valley)
This wine smells mildly herbaceous and tastes sufficiently ripe and round to make it attractive to sip.,Loft 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Subdued aromas suggesting black plum, game and moist soil come together on this. The thin simple palate offers morello cherry and a hint of brown spice alongside loose, fleeting tannins and zesty acidity.",Il Feuduccio Di S. Maria D'Orni 2014 Fonte Venna  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Aromas of steeped prune and raspberry jam mix with a note of used leather and chopped herb. The robust but evolved palate offers dried sour cherry, raisin, ground pepper and espresso alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Grainy tannins leave a bracing finish. The fruit has almost dried up completely so drink sooner rather than later.",Illuminati Dino 2010 Pieluni Riserva  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane)
"Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.",Viñalba 2014 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Valle de Uco)
"Fiery cherry cough-drop aromas are basic at best, crude at worst. Bright and wiry in feel, this tastes of medicinal red fruits.",Covila 2015 Adivino Tinto Joven  (Rioja)
"With light wood-aging flavors, this creamy wine is still young, with tangy orange and lemon zest as well as touches of vanilla. Let it develop further and drink from late 2017.",Adega Mãe 2014 Chardonnay (Lisboa)
"This is a wood-fermented wine, spicy and lightly perfumed. The wood aging does dominate the yellow fruits and acidity that still need time. Drink this wine from late 2017.",Adega Mãe 2014 Viognier (Lisboa)
"Aromas of French oak and coconut lead the nose. Oak carries over to the lean, bracing palate where you'll also detect raw sour cherry. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth puckering finish.",Barba 2013 I Vasari Old Vines  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.",Beacon Hill 2015 Riesling
"This wine is ripe, fruity and balanced. It has red-berry flavors along with acidity and a bright aftertaste. Drink from 2019",Casa Ferreirinha 2015 Esteva Red (Douro)
"This is a typically perfumed Gewürztraminer with the twist of a cool ocean climate. That coolness allows plenty of acidity to come into this dry, fruity wine and adds a floral character. With its crispness, it is bright as well as aromatic. Drink now.",Casa Santos Lima 2015 Gewurztraminer (Lisboa)
"The Birot estate is in Cadillac, the fortress town on the banks of the Garonne. This classic Sauvignon and Sémillon blend is herbal, green and grassy. It is bright with acidity and lemon fruit and with a lightly tangy texture. Drink now.",Château de Birot 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"Perfumed aromas are forced and less than natural. This feels about right, with citric acidity maintaining balance. Flavors of candied orange and cantaloupe finish with obvious residual sugar along with modest acidic cut.",Chic Barcelona NV Semi-Sec Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
This softly perfumed wine has red-fruit flavors and plenty of acidity. It is jammy and juicy with succulent red berries. Drink now.,DFJ Vinhos 2013 Paxis Pinot Noir (Lisboa)
"This wine is soft, with gentle tannins and red-berry fruits. It will develop quickly, so drink from 2019.",Prats & Symington LDA 2015 Prazo de Roriz Red (Douro)
"Strong tannins dominate this wine. It comes from a good vintage, but it is quite extracted. It could soften, although it may remain a tough wine.",Quinta do Filoco 2011 Reserva Red (Douro)
"The tannins dominate this wine, giving a hard-edged character. It is firm but without the fruit weight to support it.",Quinta dos Poços 2014 Grande Reserva Red (Douro)
"This soft, wine is full of ripe black-currant flavors. It is smooth and rounded, with a touch of wood and plenty of acidity. Drink now.",Sanguinhal 2013 Casabel Red (Lisboa)
"This six-year-old wine is 40% Tempranillo, 40% Carmenère and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Carmenère dominates, pushing stiff, tannic, stemmy flavors into the core. It's not in danger of aging too quickly, but the tannins seem unlikely to soften.",South Stage 2010 Alchemy Red (Rogue Valley)
"This frothy wine offers aromas of cut grass, hay and chopped herb. The aromas carry over to the sweet simple palate along with ripe apricot and a confectionery note.",Villa Giada 2015 Suri  (Moscato d'Asti)
"Made from Castelão grapes, this crisp wine has red fruits that burst out of the glass and give a lively aftertaste, with tight acidity. Drink now.",Manzwine 2015 Rosé (Lisboa)
"This ripe blend holds 80% Baga, with the rest Merlot. The Merlot softens the firmer tannins of the Baga, giving the wine its red-fruit character with a juicy aftertaste. Drink the wine now.",Messias 2014 Selection Red (Bairrada)
"One of the most cutting, acid-intense Albariños out there. The nose in minerally and tight as a drum, with green melon and green apple scents. The palate is razor sharp and driving, with tangy, high-toned lemon and Granny Smith apple flavors. Totally citric and zesty; it will last another few years.",Palacio de Fefiñanes 2009 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness.",Perception 2008 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Shows the classy elegance of all Qupe's Syrahs, although it's thinner and rougher than the more expensive bottlings. Still, for the price, this wine is nicely dry and intricate in blackberry and crushed pepper flavors.",Qupé 2008 Syrah (Central Coast)
"A bit thin and acidic, but charming for its dryness and firm tannins, which call for rich, marbled beef. The pepper-inspired blackberry and cassis flavors are fine. Not an ager, but will benefit from a few hours of decanting.",Ridge 2008 York Creek Zinfandel (California)
"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. The actual Syrah itself is clean and pure in ripe blackberry jam. Might do something over the years, but probably best now, with a decant.",Sanguis 2006 Waxing Poetic Syrah (California)
"Aged in large oak casks, this fresh Ripasso makes good use of minimal wood intervention that comes forth as light spice and cinnamon. The core of this wine, however, consists of pulsing black fruit and mature cherry.",Santa Sofia 2007  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso
"Vigneti di Montegradella is a well-priced Valpolicella with more intensity and density than you'd expect. In fact, the wine offers determination and personality with enough natural extraction to pair with bean soup or barbecued hamburgers.",Sartori 2006 Vigneti di Montegradella  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"This is a fresh, lively Pinot Noir for drinking now. It's elegantly silky and dry, with crisp acids and pure flavors of cherries, cola, spices and oak. A touch of oak adds smoky richness.",Scott Family 2008 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Good price for a nicely complex Cabernet for drinking now. Dry and smooth in tannins, it shows ripe blackberry, cherry, licorice and herb flavors, with a kiss of oak.",St. Francis 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"In the past, Allegrini adopted a vocal stand against Ripasso (a middle ground wine between Amarone and Valpolicella) and for this reason Corte Giara Ripasso comes as a big surprise. Despite the controversy, this historic producer presents a very acceptable wine with pretty tones of sweet spice and bright berry.",Allegrini 2008 Corte Giara  (Valpolicella Ripasso)
"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",Arger-Martucci 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This 100% Viognier shows the variety's exotic side, with delicious tropical fruit, citrus, pear, melon, lychee and smoky oak flavors. It's a bit one-dimensional, but appeals for its fresh acids and richness.",Arrowood 2008 Saralee's Vineyard Viognier (Russian River Valley)
"Hints of smoke and wet stone combine with sweet Granny Smith apple and stonefruit aromas on the nose of this inviting dry Riesling. Smoke seeps through on the palate as well, melding with brighter flavors like orange peel and underripe tangerine, making for a refreshing yet deeply compelling sip.",Atwater 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Though richly perfumed with rose petals and elderflower, the flowery aromatics are reined in by bright lemon and citrus peel notes. The palate is plush and rich with flavors evocative of earl grey tea served with rose petal jam, with a gentle acidity to keep things fresh.",Atwater 2008 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"The components of this wine are all over the place, with blackberry and currant fruit, 100% new oak, brisk tannins and acidity needing to come together for harmony. Whether or not they will is a guess. Right now it's rustic, but dry and complex enough to drink after a good decant.",Autonom 2007 Law of Proportions Syrah (California)
"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. This bottling has been falling off from the glories of the 1990s for some years now. A pity. Hopefully the trend will reverse. Production was 9,008 cases.",Beringer 2007 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Rubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.",Bodegas Tarima 2009 Monastrell (Jumilla)
"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this is another example of the fine values coming out of the Costières de Nîmes. It's a medium-bodied wine with a velvety texture and a fine balance between herbs and raspberry fruit on the one hand and dark berries and earth on the other. Drink it over the next 2–3 years.",Château Grande Cassagne 2008 Grenache-Syrah (Costières de Nîmes)
"A highly aromatic wine. Lychee is the prime scent along with white flowers, and the palate is oily but right, with lychee, ginger, spice and orange flavors. Plump but short on the finish, but clean as a whole. Very nice for Chilean Gewürz.",Cono Sur 2009 Visión Gewürztraminer (Casablanca Valley)
"A drying mineral note of slate or graphite runs through the middle of this plush and rich red Ripassato wine from Valpolicella. Background notes of spice and cherry cola come through as well, especially in the mouth where the wine boats a soft, compact feel. Pair this wine with lamb or light beef dishes.",Corteforte 2007 Podere Bertarole Ripassato  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore)
"Ripasso Cicilio shines bright with personality and freshness. This territory-driven wine boasts clean aromas of berry fruit, light shadings of spice and a touch of sweet cinnamon. It's easy, crisp mouthfeel washes clean over the palate.",Degani 2008 Cicilio  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Very dense in the mouth and full-bodied, with a dry, soft feeling. Lots of toasty oak, too. Feels somewhat inert, but the delicious cherries, toast and spices make it a pleasant sipper.",Dierberg 2007 Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"From the family behind Bosquet des Papes in Châteauneuf, this is a solid Côtes du Rhône, with modest tannins but decent structure and typical notes of leather, dried cherries, chocolate and cinnamon. Drink it over the next few years.",Domaine Nicolas Boiron 2008 Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Beefy, stocky aromas also bring herb, tomato and berry notes. The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.",Dominio de Tares 2007 Baltos Mencía (Bierzo)
"Yellow-gold in color, with baked fruit, butterscotch, creamed corn and wood resin aromas. Forcefully oaked and massive in the mouth, with enough sporty acidity to prop up the woodspice, nutmeg and resiny flavors that render the fruit secondary. Much like chewing on an oak plank, structured and layered.",Finca Allende 2008 Blanco White (Rioja)
"Slightly fiery and hot on the nose, but there's enough berry, cherry and dusty leather to keep it positive. The palate is more sheer and sharp than expected, with piercing raspberry, razor's edge acidity and only a touch of back-end sweetness. Juicy but short and searing.",Genium Celler 2006 Ecològic Red (Priorat)
"This late-release Riesling from Seneca Lake wafts with the delicate perfume of sweet peas, ripe stonefruits and a petrol undertone. Dry, but with a touch of white peach sweetness, refreshing lime juice flavors and a high toned acidity keep this wine refreshing and brisk.",Highland Cellars 2007 Oughterson Family Estates Riesling (Seneca Lake)
"Dry and refreshing with clean, pure notes of white peach, orange blossoms and petrol on the nose and palate, this shows off Riesling's pristine side. A splash of tart, underripe starfruit and fresh limes on the palate combine with a brisk acidity and wet stone minerality, giving this wine an invigorating feel.",Keuka Lake Vineyards 2008 Falling Man Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"A lively, surprising bargain made from Viognier, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. That it costs merely $8 makes the melon and apple aromas and flavors all the better. Citrusy as it evolves, and clean throughout, with no wavering. A very nice white quaffing wine.",Korta 2009 Viognier-Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay White (Lontué Valley)
"Amarone Capitel de' Roari delivers a crisp, lean expression that showcases Valpolicella winemaking tradition. The only out-of-place elements are the oak shadings that comes across as toasted nut, leather and dried tobacco.",Luigi Righetti 2007 Capitel de' Roari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"New leather, pressed rose, violet, baking spice and crushed herb are just some of the aromas you'll find in this textbook Barolo. Firm yet loaded with finesse, the palate offers red cherry, strawberry compote, cinnamon and clove notes set against a backdrop of youthfully austere tannins and bright acidity. A licorice note lingers on the finish. Give it time to fully bloom. Drink 2023–2033.",Francesco Rinaldi 2013 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"Quite light in color, the aromas bring initially locked up but then broadly expansive notes of peat, green olive, white pepper, strawberry, Stargazer lilies, mineral and herb, showing a lot of complexity. The palate is textured, bringing a profound mixture of fruit and savory flavors that intertwine effortlessly on the long finish. It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating.",No Girls 2014 La Paciencia Vineyard Grenache (Walla Walla Valley (OR))
"Hearty aromas of black cherry and mulberry meet with rustic iron, dark spice, crushed slate and dried sagebrush on the expertly woven nose of this bottling by a Southern California-based vintner. The palate balances bright acidity with upright tannins, allowing the dark-red fruit and mace spice flavors to shine.",Orfila 2014 Sequestered Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Juicy and stemmy, this is a big, bold wine, explosive in highlights of huckleberry, dark cherry and forest floor. With firm tannins for days, it offers enviable length and spice along a smooth grippy texture and forceful complexity.",Saintsbury 2015 Stanly Ranch Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable.",Sheldon 2016 Springloaded Monkey Paw Luc's Vineyard Tempranillo (Sonoma County)
"The 2014 Coleraine is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 28% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Franc. Some herbal, cabbagey notes blow off with air to reveal vanilla, cedar, cassis, blackberry and mocha. Full bodied and plush, this wine is soft enough to drink now, but could probably go 20-plus years.",Te Mata 2014 Coleraine Red (Hawke's Bay)
"Saturated in color as well as on the nose, this fruit-packed Malbec opens with grapy black-plum and cassis aromas.

"Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit.

"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit.

The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.",El Esteco 2013 Chañar Punco Red (Calchaquí Valley)
"This is from a tremendous vineyard site near the top of the appellation, situated from 1,250 to 1,800 feet. It incorporates small additions of Zinfandel and Carignane into the whole, a picture of soft beguiling violet aromas that are followed by a velvety texture and underlying grip of tannin. Rich red fruit and a taste of licorice linger on the intense finish.",Elyse 2012 York Creek Vineyard Petite Sirah (Spring Mountain District)
"Named after an ancestor who pioneered using oak barrels for maturing Sauvignon Blanc, the wine is, of course, wood aged. It is also ripe with yellow fruits, spice and vanilla. Apricot is cut with more tangy orange zest and finished with acidity. This is a concentrated wine that is just ready to drink.",Henri Bourgeois 2014 Etienne Henri  (Sancerre)

"Generous oak is reflected via aromas of hickory and smoke on the nose of this lusty but refined blend of Cabernet and Malbec. In the mouth, rugged tannins and high acidity suggest further cellaring. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and tomato sauce finish with dry, pulling tannins and a sense of acidic freshness. Drink through 2027.",Bodega Catena Zapata 2013 Nicolas Catena Zapata Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec (Mendoza)
"Floral and surprisingly bright, this wine is driven by sharply etched acidity and citrus—its flavors balanced and complementary. Red cherry and raspberry find companionship in seasonings of cinnamon and clove, the texture slightly leathery and bold.",Carlisle 2015 Limerick Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)

It is concentrated, with ripe red-cherry and blackberry fruits, solid tannins and acidity. Drink this wine from 2020.",Casa Anadia 2013 Palácio Anadia Reserva Touriga Nacional (Dão)
"This is a mature, single-vineyard wine. Beautifully perfumed, it includes, unusually, a small percentage of white grapes (historically a field blend) that soften the tannins of the 90% Baga. The wine is spicy, concentrated, dense with black fruits and tannins. It is ready to drink.",Casca Wines 2012 Monte Cascas Vinha das Cardosas Red (Bairrada)

"88-90 Barrel sample. Caramel new wood aromas are followed by spice and toast flavors. The fruit seems thin by comparison, hard to feel under all that polished toast.",Château Kirwan 2008 Barrel sample  (Margaux)
"88-90 Barrel sample. A dark hued wine, with its tense tannins giving a strong backbone to the dry, firm structure. The fruit hardly shows through all this dry, extracted character.",Château Latour-Martillac 2008 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)
"Representing four generations of winemaking, Vietti makes a strong show with this intense and vibrant ruby colored wine. Layers of toast, coffee and ripe red fruit reveal themselves to the nose with deep spice and clove that last long on the palate. This wine boasts solid structure and power.",Vietti 2003 Tre Vigne  (Barbera d'Asti)
"88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.",Château Bourgneuf-Vayron 2006 Barrel sample  (Pomerol)
"88—90 Barrel sample. Firm and dry, here is a wine that still offers plenty of ripe fruits. There are good blackcurrant flavors, along with the dry tannins that are as much wood as fruit driven.",Château Haut-Bergey 2006 Barrel sample  (Pessac-Léognan)

"Bold and earthy wine, with aromas of fine rubber, balsam wood, forest floor, spice and ripe black fruit.

"Delicate and light-bodied with plenty to love in the nose, including irresistible notes of bread dough, strawberry and lemon which turn to fresh cherries in the mouth.

"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",Pine & Brown 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.",Point & Line 2014 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Fresh grapefruit, lime and lemon collide in this invigorating waterfall of citrus flavors. Off dry in style and breathlessly light in texture, it hits the palate with an electric edge of acidity that reverberates through a long finish. Drink now through 2024.",Schloss Johannisberger 2014 Rotlack Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Dry tannins provide a leathery texture atop piquant sensibilities of cedar, pencil and chocolate-specked blackberry jam. Structured and full bodied, it'll benefit from further cellaring. Drink now through 2022.",Sequoia Grove 2012 Cambium Red (Napa Valley)
"Different and intriguing, this tightly wound wine has white pepper aromas, tart cherry and raspberry flavors and an engaging, astringent mouthfeel. High in acidity and relatively low in body, it has a vibrancy and restraint that will benefit from more time in the bottle. Best after 2019.",Skinner 2013 Mourvèdre (El Dorado)
"Single block wines, such as this one, often show a tight focus rather than a broad palate. Here it works well, wrapping savory notes around red currant fruit. There's a lightly metallic ring to the flavors, running straight through the finish. Give this a few hours of decanting, or tuck it away for drinking after 2020.",Sokol Blosser 2013 Goosepen Block Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Farmed by the vineyard manager who owns Small Vines, another small Pinot Noir producer, this is a complex, well-crafted wine, high in acidity and high-toned red fruit, like cranberry, pomegranate and cherry, with a wisp of orange peel on their heels. Light-bodied, it finishes with black tea and mushrooms fighting for attention.",Gros Ventre 2013 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This wine has bold aromas of wood smoke and vanilla, a very firm, fine-grained and tannic texture, and lots of black cherry and dark plum flavors. It's a big, robust wine—pour alongside hefty proteins and settle back for the evening.",Hawk and Horse Vineyards 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
"While subdued and closed off at initial tasting, time and aeration seem to bring out this wine's vibrant tangerine and apricot perfume. The spry palate is delicately sweet, juxtaposing fresh, primary stone fruit and lime flavors against a backdrop of savory earth and nut. It's a quiet wine that should gain power and depth with maturity. Hold until 2020.",Joh. Jos. Prüm 2014 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Pristine, primary tangerine and grapefruit flavors shine brilliantly throughout this crisp, light-footed Spätlese. It's dangerously quaffable, yet nuanced by shades of candlewax, mineral and saffron that extend the finish dramatically.",Johannishof 2014 Rüdesheimer Berg Rottland Spätlese Riesling (Rheingau)
"Refined and complex, this limited-production, vineyard-designate wine starts with lemony acidity, but there's much more to discover as it bores down through the palate. Meyer lemons, grapefruit and nectarines are in the mix, with refreshing minerality.",King Estate 2014 Antiquum Vineyards Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Pretty in jasmine, lemon and orange, this is a crisp, dry and lovely wine, integrated with just enough heft on the body and a surprisingly deft length on the finish. Stock up for gatherings.",Kokomo 2015 Grenache Rosé (North Coast)
"Closed and in need of air at first, this takes on a ripe, medicinal, almost candied red-fruit nose. Next up is a full, wide-bodied palate with chunky plum and raspberry flavors. This old-vines Garnacha is ripe, tasty and all about the fruit. Drink through 2020.",Palacios Remondo 2011 Propiedad  (Rioja)
"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones. Coiled within its thickness of tannin and dense cherry are ethereal, earthy whispers of intrigue and acidity. This is a lively, lovely wine.",Lang & Reed 2013 Two-Fourteen Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"Clean aromas of honeysuckle converge with richer, rounded components of Asian pear, coconut and pineapple on the nose of this single vineyard expression. There's a caramel touch at the tip of the rich sip, with layers of brown spice, yellow fruit and rocky earth.",Lucienne 2013 Lone Oak Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness.",MacPhail 2013 The Flyer Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This wine is a bold but well-mannered blockbuster that serves generous helpings of dark color, spicy aromas, concentrated flavors and a luxurious dry texture. It needs full-flavored, rich food to accompany it, and will deliver a lot of pleasure under those circumstances. Best to drink now through 2020.",Michael David 2013 Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication.",Navarro 2014 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine is agile and elegant, very firm in texture without being too full-bodied. It smells lightly smoky, slightly herbal and tastes moderately rich as subtle plum and pomegranate flavors transition to richer berry and cocoa notes on the finish. It needs time to show more complexity, so drink after 2020.",Occasio 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"Another stunning deal on this annual bottling, this wine is jammy and fruity on the nose with buttered cherries and berry jam, yet layered with baking spice and wet clay minerality. Dried strawberries, black cherries and plums show on the palate, enhanced by a toasted clove, graphite, juniper and forest floor mintiness.",Pali 2014 Huntington Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-purée flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.",Pear Valley 2013 Distraction Red (Paso Robles)
"This wine has jazzy, jammy aromas and ripe blackberry and strawberry flavors, wrapping them in a warm layer of fine-grained tannins and a nice dash of sweet baking spices from aging in oak.",Renwood 2013 Riker Vineyard Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Aromas of Italian herbs like basil and oregano blend with eucalyptus and black-fruit scents. Chunky, clampy, bumpy tannins define the mouthfeel on this Cab-Syrah blend, while roasted flavors of plum, berry and chocolate finish herbal, meaty and warm. Drink through 2020.",San Pedro 2013 1865 Limited Edition Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)
"Rounded strawberry, orange peel, tart black raspberry and a touch of juniper pop on the nose of this appellation blend by members of the pioneering Bargetto family. Black plum skins, crushed slate, raspberry juice and fresh-picked thyme show on the palate.",Soquel Vineyards 2013 Library Selection Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Floral, pretty and light, this wine was made for porch sitting and all-around relaxing. It never gives up on fruit and complexity, offering a medium body and vibrant acidity around the rose-petaled texture. This is a lovely sipper.",Starmont 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"The slightest shade of yellowish pink, this wine is a great study of fresh acidity and compelling texture in a rosé. Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.",Stephen Ross 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Though pale in hue, this is big in flavor. It's a textbook Pinot Noir rosé, sharp, tight and showing deep flavors of rhubarb, rosewater and strawberry fruit. There's exceptional length along with the lovely, fresh fruit flavors.",Stoller 2015 Pinot Noir Rosé (Dundee Hills)
"This is a lovely, full-bodied expression of apple blossom aromas, just-ripe pear and orange Creamsicle, a balanced mix of rich and sublime that remains smooth and silky on the palate with a lingering finish.",Stonehedge 2014 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Fresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around. This fruit-forward Crianza is mouth-filling and borders on lush. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry, pepper and spice finish solid as a rock, with length and a confirming sense of quality.",Bodegas Landaluce 2012 Fincas Landaluce Crianza  (Rioja)
"This Crianza is strapping on the nose, with fairly big but not overdone black-fruit aromas. A ripe, chewy palate with moderate tannins holds peppery wild berry flavors that settle on plum. A dark, toasty, peppery finish is mild and smooth. Overall, this offers a lot to like.",Bodegas Palacio 2012 Cosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja)
"Dominated by Pinot Noir, this is a tight and stalky wine. It is almost too light, with its acidity and tight tannins to the front. Probably as it softens it will round out, so wait until late 2016 to drink.",Benoît Daridan 2014 Pinot Noir-Gamay (Cheverny)
"Made from Pinot Noir, this fresh and light rosé is packed with red berries and lively acidity. It is perfumed, dry and very fruity. Drink now.",Benoît Daridan 2014 Rosé (Cheverny)

"A hint of sweat in the nose blows away to reveal a solid core of cherry fruit, along with broad flavors of stem, coffee and earth. This wine is substantial, though that slightly funky character lingers into the finish.",Cummins Road 2012 Pinot Noir
"Warm and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of espresso, fig, dried berry, toasted oak and clove. The dense palate offers raisin, oak, roasted coffee bean and spearmint alongside round tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol.",Il Falchetto 2013 Bricco Paradiso  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Aromas of crushed dark-skinned berry, violet, clove and a hint of chopped herb lead the nose. The lean palate offers raw raspberry, sour cherry and ground pepper alongside firm tannins. A note of bitter walnut closes the finish.",La Fusina 2013  Dogliani Superiore
"Saffron and orange blossoms perfume this intensely ripe, almost honey-slick Kabinett. There's a zesty backbone of tangerine acidity, but the palate is a crush of ruddy yellow peach and nectarine flavors. It's a luscious, forward wine to enjoy young.",Leonard Kreusch 2014 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Crisp almost scratchy aromas of herbal red fruits are a bit strained. This feels solid, with ample volume. Earthy flavors of tomato sauce, mixed spices, stewed plum and cassis finish long and herbal, with some grace.",Luigi Bosca 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)

"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors. Big tannins need time in the glass to mellow.",Mount Veeder 2012 Reserve Red (Mount Veeder)

"Slightly oxidized tones of pressed apple and pear are lifted by a shock of lemony acidity in this spry semi-dry Riesling. The tangerine palate extends moderately long, encouraged by a swathe of dried herb notes.",Peter Nicolay 2014 Ürziger Goldwingert Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Aromas of mature plum, espresso, coconut and toasted oak lead the nose. The firm palate offers fig, blackberry jam, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",Podere Ruggeri Corsini 2012 Armujan  (Barbera d'Alba)
This is a solid mineral and tannin dominated wine. It has black currant fruits which are still buried by the tense tannins and stalky texture. It therefore needs some time to develop and broaden out. Drink from 2018.,Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2011 Pomares Red (Douro)
"This wine comes from Alexander Valley-grown Malbec, a variety the producer has been planting in earnest over the last few years. Dark pink-red, it is medium bodied and refreshing, with notes of cherry, blueberry and vanilla.",Rodney Strong 2014 Rosé of Malbec (Sonoma County)

"Perfumed aromas of cherry, forest floor and cinnamon bring appeal to this light-colored wine. It's delicate and airy in style, with cranberry flavors on the finish.",Larkspur 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This estate-grown effort is almost jet black, and scented with tar, smoke and black fruits. It's dense beyond dense, and completely shut down. Even after aeration, decanting, and hours of breathing time, it remained stubbornly closed. Brief hints of tobacco and earth, cassis and coffee suggest that with more bottle age, this one could really blossom.",Ledger David 2013 Malbec (Rogue Valley)
"Black cherry, chipped slate and an earthy nutmeg character show on the nose of this stylishly labeled bottling. Medium in weight, it offers energetic and tart cranberry-cherry flavors as well as a menthol element on the palate, which is tangy throughout and wipes up clean.",Liberated 2013 Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"The wine is young, still more structure than fruit. It has firm tannins as well as juicy blackberry fruits. A blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Touriga Nacional, it is likely to age for a few months, so drink from the end of 2016.",Fiuza 2014 3 Castas Red (Tejo)
"An earthy, leathery, spicy nose dominates this 100% Cabernet from 17-year-old vines.

"A much more concentrated version of the regular bottling. The fruit is still raspberries and cherries, but there is more focus and power, and it’s wrapped in smooth milk chocolate. A flat-out delicious bottle of Merlot.",Canoe Ridge 1998 Reserve Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"From the highest (at 1,000 feet) of the Kunde's vineyards, it's lavishly oaked, with aromas of butterscotch, spice and custard; also nutty and creamy notes. Marked by intense tropical fruit aromas and oriental spices, it also tastes very rich. It's the best of a very good trio of limited-production Chardonnay wines.",Kunde 1998 C.S. Ridge Vineyard Chardonnay (California)
"This massively oaky wine smells like an explosion in a spice factory, with ginger, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg aromas, accented by vanilla, brown sugar, butterscotch and honey. Somewhere in there is some ripe tropical fruit. Enormous and full-bodied, it's a dense, unctuous wine.",Signorello 1998 Hope's Cuvée Chardonnay (California)
"Harvested at a lip-smacking 42.5° brix, this seductive wine explodes on the palate with bright grapefruit and citrus flavors, highlighted with sharp acids and finishing with lingering notes of caramel and butter. Long and delicious.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 1997 Late Harvest Sémillon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The effusive, floral, fragrant nose opens into phenomenal tangerine and satsuma orange flavors, enlivened with spice and a wonderful, refreshing mouthfeel (from barrel fermentation). Best Buy.",Canoe Ridge 1999 Oak Ridge Vineyard Gewürztraminer (Washington)
"After you've had oceans of Chardonnay and don't think there's room for a drop more, along comes a wine like this to change your mind. It's not just the peach, pear and tropical fruit, or the honeyed, vanilla-scented buttered toast, or the oriental spices, or the clean acidity, or the rich, creamy texture. It's all of these together, in a balanced package.",Château Souverain 1998 Winemaker's Reserve Chardonnay (California)
"This David Lake Signature Series wine blends two different clones, Sangiovese Piccolo and Sangiovese Grosso, and starts with a lovely, complex bouquet of rose petals, strawberry, watermelon, cherry and cocoa. It's supple, elegant and graceful, with pretty accents and subtle spicy highlights nicely spaced across the palate. A delicate, sensuous wine.",Columbia Winery 1998 Red Willow Vyd Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
"A tremendously rich, oaky Chard that will blast your socks off and then some. The fruit is really complex, ranging from green apples to savory ripe peaches on into tropical fruit, and there's a dusty sprinkling of cinnamon and ginger. For sur-lie freaks, there's lots of creamy, yeasty, nutty notes contributing to this delicious, hard-hitting wine.",Kunde 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"This unusually rich wine has it all: ripe, round citrus and peach fruit compounded with oaky notes of vanilla, toast and butter. There's none of that grassy, straw character you find in so many North Coast offerings. With its fine, spicy finish, it's one of the best Sauvignon Blancs of the vintage. Contains 9% Sémillon.",Gainey 1998 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors. Shows some interesting herbal nuances of thyme and oregano. Good focus in a fruit-forward style; tight and delicious with a pretty finish.",Andrew Will 1999 Ciel du Cheval Sangiovese (Yakima Valley)
"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",Mirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California)
"The big, powerful nose showcases blackberry, plum and brambly components. This tight, tannic, nicely constructed, ageworthy Cabernet features dark licorice streaks running through the long finish.",Seven Hills 1997 Klipsun Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lovely, fruity wine, with ripe apples and peaches dominating. But there's also plenty of toasty new oak and roasted hazelnuts. Soft and approachable, with a bright, hot finish.",Woodward Canyon 1999 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Spice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish. Good acid balance. It's still very young, but immediately delicious.",Kiona 1999 Ice Wine Chenin Blanc (Yakima Valley)
"This represents the winery's attempt to recreate a Côte Rôtie-like wine. It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.",Bridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast)
"An exceptional wine from this historic producer. Very aromatic, with generous blueberry, chocolate, mint, mushroom, and sweet charred oak. Rich and full-bodied. The fruity ripeness is delicious and sweet. The mouthfeel is luscious and creamy, and it finishes with a slight tannic bite. Probably at its youthful best now.",Louis M. Martini 1997 Merlot (Chiles Valley)
"This wine needs food so much, it practically cries out loud for it. It's like the essence of lemons and grapefruits, in a bone-dry, crisply tart package that makes the taste buds sing. The oak has been kept in the background to emphasize the clean, racy flavors, although partial sur-lie aging adds creamy notes. Oysters and this wine would be a marriage made in heaven.",Robert Mondavi 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Stags Leap District)
"They took only the best fruit they could find for this expensive wine, and made only 1,280 cases of it. Using every Burgundian trick in the book, winemaker Steve Test has created a rich, creamy wine, long on smoky oak and yeasty lees, with impressive spice and fruit that veers toward peaches and more tropical notes.",Merryvale 1998 Silhouette Chardonnay (California)
"Bright, forward fruit and spice characterize this very rich, complex wine. The aromas veer toward banana and ripe peach and pear, with oriental spices, vanilla, and toast. In the mouth, the flavors are fruity, with a leesy streak. High acidity makes it a little sharp, while the texture is creamy. All in all, it's very balanced, except for that sharpness, which a year or two of aging should mellow.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Beckstoffer Ranch Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The aromas are similar to the above wine, maybe a little less forward and earthier, but still dominated by tropical fruit and oaky complexities. It drinks quite a bit softer, though, with lower acidity, which makes it seem richer, fatter, and more user friendly. You can taste the pretty fruit on the finish.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The lovely, lushly fruity nose features plenty of buttery, roasted walnut scents from new oak fermentation. Despite the oak, it retains its freshness and acid balance, keeping it lively through a long, toasty finish.",Columbia Winery 1998 Otis Vineyard Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"On one level this is a straightforward wine, varietally correct with lemony flavors. It's very dry and tart, with some nutty, oily nuances from 12% Sémillon. However, it has that undefinable something that makes it elegant and interesting. You find yourself reaching for it when richer, oakier, lusher wines pall.",Merryvale 1999 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Blended with a small amount of Merlot (10%), this wine sends up a classic bouquet of cassis and berry, with a nice hint of mint. It’s well crafted, but tight and a little hard yet, especially in the finish. Built for aging.",Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Blueberries, plums, and especially cherries, with a lovely, soft, beguiling bouquet of rose blossoms and chocolate. Crisply structured, with tight fruit, soft tannins, and a medium-weight, extended finish.",Seven Hills 1997 Seven Hills Vineyard Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The aromas are much more closed and dense than the regular bottling. Airing reveals plum, currant and cinnamon, and a good dose of toasty oak. Thick and dense, with fine fruit, intricate tannins, and oak. Delicious now, but will gain complexity with short-term aging. Only 329 cases produced.",Schug 1997 Heritage Reserve Merlot (Carneros)
"Dark, rich, and ultraripe yet balanced, this wine has plenty of charm. You can taste the warm California sunshine in each ripe sip. All kinds of wild berry and dark stone-fruit flavors mingle with spices and herbs, with a smoky, oaky overlay. Not great wine, but completely satisfying, and one that most will find lip-smackingly delicious.",Bridlewood 1998 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"A new wine from a new winery. It's actually from a warm easterly section of Napa, Pope Valley, that seems to coax honeydew and watermelon flavors from the grapes. The wine, which is very dry, has been given the royal treatment, with barrel fermentation and extended lees aging, so there's that lovely creamy mouthfeel; malolactic fermentation softens it even more. Pretty lush stuff from a winery to watch.",Eagle & Rose Estate 1998 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Smells oakier and fruitier than the regular bottling, with pretty peach and green-apple notes. There's a fair amount of richness on the palate. The fruit is spicy and ripe, and the oak adds spice and a sappy sweetness. Very balanced and likable, and certainly a nice food wine.",Hoodsport 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",Columbia Winery 1998 Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"This is a textbook traditional Rioja, with dry spice, earth, light herbal notes and leather on the nose alongside cherry and plum scents. The palate is crisp, elegant and pure, with raspberry, vanilla, plum and leathery flavors. Modest complexity and elegance rise up on the finish. Drink through 2018.",Bodegas Valdemar 2007 Conde de Valdemar Reserva  (Rioja)
"Blackberry, black currant, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors mark this dry, tannic Cabernet. It shows real Oakville character, at a good price. Gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now–2015.",Cameron Hughes 2011 Lot 418 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"This forward Brunello opens with a fruit and spice fragrance of ripe black berries, cinnamon and hot red pepper. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry, ripe black raspberry, black pepper and cake spices alongside dusty tannins.",Il Poggione 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Inky, floral depth with the spice of French oak leads to a fullish but toned body full of dark elderberry and plum fruits. There's a dark, brooding subtext despite the obviously mellowing oak flavors and a core of spice that will fulfil its promise with some further time in bottle. The concentrated power here comes from partially dried grapes. The tannins are pliable and supple. Enjoy as of 2016.",Juris 2011 Tricata Red (Weinland Österreich)
"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla. Earthy and leathery on the palate, it shows a taste of baked plum on the finish, as well as tobacco, a nice balance between Syrah's darker and brighter sides.",Kale 2009 Alder Springs Vineyard Spirit Rock Syrah (Mendocino County)
"Freshly cut green pears and crunchy, ripe apples have immediate appeal. This fruity freshness continues on the sleek and super-clean palate, which leads to a refreshing, long finish.",Zull 2012 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017.",Château La Garricq 2011  Moulis-en-Médoc
"This is a delightfully perfumed wine, the second wine of Château L'Evangile. Smooth with ripe Merlot flavors, it's full and dense, conveying the sense that it will mature quickly. Drink from 2016.",Château l'Évangile 2011 Blason de l'Evangile  (Pomerol)
"A firm, dense wine, it currently shows plenty of dry tannins along with potentially ripe fruits. Already showing balance, it is developing into a complex, rich wine that will be full of black fruits and smoother tannins. Drink from 2017.",Château Saint-Estèphe 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"Generous, sweetly perfumed aromas of melon and lemon oil lead into a wine with precision and penetration. Spicy, candied ginger complements the citrus and tropical fruit, and barrel fermentation gives it a gently buttery mouthfeel.",Coeur d'Alene 2012 Viognier (Washington)
"This wine shows real depth, beginning with earthy aromas of underbrush, ripe berried fruit, blue flower and smidge of leather. The palate offers a core of black cherry accented with notes of baking spices and a hint of truffle alongside a solid tannic backbone and nervous acidity that restrains the berry richness. Drink 2016–2024.",Conti Costanti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"This earthy Brunello leads with aromas of underbrush, mushroom, bay leaf, cherry and Mediterranean herbs. The palate offers juicy black cherry and ripe raspberry punctuated with cinnamon-spice, vanilla, mocha and licorice alongside smoothed but fleeting tannins. It's nicely crafted and boasts decent freshness for the vintage.",Corte dei Venti 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness.",DaMa 2011 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.",DiamAndes 2011 de Uco Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Aromas of dried cheese, iodine and candied fruits settle with airing. In the mouth, this is firm and tannic, with savory, oaky flavors of hickory, blackened toast and roasted berry fruits. On the finish, there's both weight and elegance. Best from 2015 through 2020.",Emilio Moro 2010  Ribera del Duero
"This delivers a classic Sangiovese nose of wild cherry, leather, violet, iris, flint and spice. The dense palate reveals fleshy black cherry uplifted by menthol, eucalyptus, black pepper and sage. It's still young but should develop more complexity over the next few years. Drink 2016–2023.",Fattoria dei Barbi 2008 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.",Finca Lalande 2012 Made with organically grown grapes Malbec (Tupungato)
"Subdued aromas of pear peel give way to fleshy pear fruit framed with grapefruit acidity. Harmonious and reined-in, the wine combines elegance with fruity concentration.",Fritsch 2012 Mordthal Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
"Chardonnays from Mount Veeder are rare, but the mountain can be a good home for that variety. Godspeed's 2012 is dry, brisk in acidity and enormously rich in tropical fruit, pear and apricot fruit flavors, enhanced with oak. Drink this Chard now with fancy fare, such as wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tartare and chicken lasagna.",Godspeed 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Mount Veeder)
"Lovely restraint and a soft, pliable creamy core on this concentrated wine that boasts buffered acidity as clear and pretty as a bell.",Gross 2012 Sulz Sauvignon Blanc (Südsteiermark)
"This food-friendly Pinot Noir has a light body, dryness and crisp acidity that make it easy to pair with steaks, chops, salmon, mushroom risotto and similar fare. There's nothing shy, however, about the flavors, which brim with ripe raspberries, cherries and pomegranates, accented with toasty, spicy oak. Drink now–2017.",Rodney Strong 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dark berry and baking spice aromas emerge from the glass and carry over to the juicy palate together with fleshy wild cherry, plum, black pepper, cinnamon and vanilla alongside big round tannins. Well balanced with great length, this poised wine already is accessible, so drink 2015–2019.",San Lorenzo 2009 Bramante  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Yeasty aromas give way to a ripe, plump palate. Varietally typical phenolic richness is kept in check by acidity.",Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Juicy pear mingles into a savory, almost soy-spiced midpalate. Round and rich, it leads to a pleasantly bitter and ultra-clean finish.",Schloss Gobelsburg 2012 Renner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Licorice, cardamom, blueberry and cassis aromas are subtle but complementary. A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish. This blend of 67% Malbec and 33% Cab Sauvignon is ripe, ready and exemplifies Mendoza's penchant for big wines with balance. Only 150 cases made.",TeHo 2011 Red Blend Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Although the color is an evolved garnet with brick edges, this wine offers a fresh nose of blue flower, gingerbread and ripe cherry with hints of toast and clove. The palate is evolved but still delivers ripe red cherry, vanilla and espresso along with smoothed tannins and soft acidity. Not much complexity and even though it's forward, it's also balanced. Drink through 2019.",Tenuta di Sesta 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Brawny and forward, it leads with alluring fragrances of blue flower, underbrush, forest berries, balsamic herbs and leather. The juicy palate delivers mature wild cherry layered with white pepper, cinnamon, thyme and mint. While already deliciously accessible, it should develop some complexity in the next few years but don't hold too long. Drink through 2019.",Terre Nere 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Vintner Adriano Gigante delivers a thick, resiny Ribolla Gialla with aromas of candied fruit, caramel and apricot. Try this pretty wine with ravioli stuffed with yellow squash.",Gigante 2010 Ribolla Gialla (Colli Orientali del Friuli)
"White flowers and peach start this slightly simple but good white from Greece. On the palate, lemon and orange flavors join with a honeyed spice. The overall character is balanced and friendly.",Greek Wine Cellars 2010 Moscofilero Moschofilero (Mantinia)
"On the sugary side, with sweetened pineapple, green apple and peach flavors that are brightened with crisp acidity. If you like your white wines on the sweet side, this is a good price.",Bella Ragazza 2010 Pinot Grigio (California)
"Shows plenty of oak influence, wrapping around tropical fruit notes. It's richly textured if somewhat low in acid, giving it a weighty feel on the palate. Drink now.",Vinum 2010 White Elephant White (California)
"There's a chalky, almost sweet element to the mouthfeel that recalls Pez candy or lemon soda. The fruit aromas are bright, intense and make up for the streamlined mouthfeel.",Castelfeder 2010 15er Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"Lunaria is a very interesting wine that represents one of the only attempts at making Sauvignon Blanc in the Forlì area of central Italy. Great for appetizers or easy vegetarian pasta dishes, it offers citrus, passion fruit and chopped sage aromas.",Castelluccio 2009 Lunaria Sauvignon Blanc (Forlì)
This crisp Vermentino would make a great companion to smoked salmon or swordfish carpaccio. The wine is bright and zesty with simple citrus and spice on the close.,Conte Ferdinando Guicciardini 2009 Massi di Mandorlaia Vermentino (Maremma)
"This wine has the plucky character typical of Greece, but with a polished spin. The nose is allspice, cherry and cocoa, and on the palate, dried fruits, coffee, mesquite smoke and chocolate. The wine finishes spicy and clean. Good, if not a bit aggressive. Pair with meat or hearty fare.",Estate Constantin Gofas 2008 Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Here's an easy Grechetto from central Italy that offers sun-denched aromas of apricot, honeysuckle, white mineral and a touch of tangy, sweet spice. This native Italian grape pairs beautifully with white meat, fish or salad.",Fongoli 2009 Grechetto (Colli Martani)
"Generic on the nose, with undistinguished aromas of red fruits and candy. Feels plump and tastes a bit stalky, with generic red cherry, plum skin and candied flavors. Harmless and a touch sweet; drink well chilled.",Kaiken 2010 Rosé of Malbec Rosé (Mendoza)
"This Moschofilero starts with honeyed peach, spice and lemon aromas, followed by a light touch of peach and minerals on the palate. Easy drinking and linear, this wine will pair well with cheese and light fare.",Lafazanis 2010 Electus Moschofilero (Mantinia)
"Made with organically farmed fruit, this bright blend of Grechetto (80%) and Malvasia offers easy aromas of citrus, grapefruit and a touch of mature pineapple. The wine is fresh, lean and compact.",Moretti Omero 2009 Nessuno White (Umbria)
"Shows the weakness of certain Napa Valley Chardonnays, with a dry herbaceous taste that accentuates the acidity and even the tannins. Although there are pineapple and oak flavors, the wine lacks interest.",Peter Franus 2010 Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Fresh, informal and fun (in a screwcap bottle), this organically farmed Pinot Grigio delivers bright aromas of cut grass, exotic fruit and citrus. It's an easy wine with a carefree attitude.",TerrAmore 2010 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"You almost have to classify this Riesling as a dessert wine, because it crosses the line from off-dry into frankly sweet. It's an easy sipper, with honeyed tangerine and pear flavors. Could be a little brighter in acidity, though.",Bogle 2010 Riesling (California)
"Luscious aromas of ripe peach and citrus are followed by balanced waves of peach, lemon curd and melon on the palate. Soft in style and approachable, this is a good everyday white that drinks very well on its own or paired with poultry, salads.",Boutari 2010 Moschofilero (Mantinia)
"Shows ripe, grapey raspberry and cherry jam flavors, with a bite of citrusy acidity. A good Pinot Noir for drinking with roast salmon or a juicy hamburger.",Carmel Road 2010 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"Carpineto consistently delivers clean, territory-driven wines at competitive prices. This lively Vernaccia opens with green apple, cut grass and dried sage aromas. It would pair nicely with a heaping plate of fried calamari rings.",Carpineto 2010  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"A value-driven Cabernet to be sure and one, under the Conservancy mantra, that serves to raise funds to protect vineyard land from urban development. This vintage is full, with baked plum and earthy flavors, even-handed overall, with a hint of green bean on the finish.",Concannon 2009 Conservancy Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)
"A heavy, dark and loud Malbec with bullish floral and black fruit aromas. Offers vise-grip tannins and borderline-overpowering blackberry flavors. Darkens on the finish, leaving espresso bitterness and chocolaty spice.",DiamAndes 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"It's a proper Pinot Noir in the silky texture and cherry and cola flavors, which finish smooth and dry. Other than that, it's rustic and heavy.",J. Lohr 2010 Falcon's Perch Pinot Noir (Monterey County)
"Rounded, ripe, this Grüner is finely balanced, with apple flavors and a citric edge. It has intense acidity with a creamy character, and is ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Laurenz V. 2010 Laurenz and Sophie Singing Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
This quickly veers from being delicately light into simply sour and grassy. Cucumber- and tart melon-flavored fruit fades into a short finish.,LaVelle 2010 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"The vineyard is a great one, but this Chardonnay tastes way too oaky. It's swamped by buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors that barely give the underlying pineapple and lemon fruits a chance to express themselves.",Merryvale 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Simple, clean and fresh, this no-fuss Pinot Grigio would pair nicely against Chinese take-out or an outdoor salad lunch. It shows clean aromas of citrus and white peach.",Montresor 2010 Pinot Grigio (Valdadige)
"There's a toasty streak that adds depth to the apple and melon fruit core of this wine. Soft tropical fruit accents appear in the mouth, with a brioche-flavored finish sealing the deal.",Mullineux 2011 Kloof Street Chenin Blanc (Swartland)
This expression of Müller-Thurgau is thin and crisp in the mouth with lemon and candied fruit aromas on the nose. The aromas are flatter and less floral than you might expect from this fragrant grape variety.,Nals Margreid 2009 Müller-Thurgau (Alto Adige)
"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.",Chaltén 2007 Reserva Pinot Noir (Neuquén)
"The main nonvintage Champagne from Drappier is open, fresh and very easy. The fruit shows pears and apricots, tightened up by some green apple skins. The general feel is softness. An enjoyable apéritif Champagne.",Drappier NV Carte d'Or Brut  (Champagne)
"This is a drily astringent Zinfandel with bracing acidity, and it's a little tough right now. But it has enough briary mountain berry fruit, clove and savory pepper flavors to work against barbecued meats and poultry.",Fernwood 2005 Estate Zinfandel (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay. It has pleasant pineapple, peach and lemon flavors and crisp acidity, and while it's not especially complex, it's a nice Chard for drinking now.",Hendry 2005 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",Vino Sapien 2006 Thompson Vineyard Granddaddy Grenache (Santa Barbara County)
"The winery continues to try to figure out how to grow Cabernet in this remote part of the county. Ripeness isn't the problem. Structure is. The flavors are upfront in blackberries, cherries and currants, but complexity and dryness remain challenges.",La Fenêtre 2006 Santa Barbara Highlands Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",Mercer 2007 Pinot Gris (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a good, every day effort, much like the baseline Ste. Michelle Sauvignon Blancs. Lightly grassy, lemony and tart, it is an all-purpose quaffer.",Mercer 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A beat or two off the pace of previous vintages, the '04 is a little soft and one-dimensional. Tastes like it was baked by the heat, with jammy white and yellow fruit flavors that have a trace of bitterness.",Merryvale 2004 Silhouette Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"A fine unoaked Pinot Grigio that shows the crispness, delicate body and richness you want in this variety. The citrus, honeysuckle and vanilla flavors could be drier, but lots of people will enjoy that edge of sugar.",Pietra Santa 2007 Amore Pinot Grigio (Cienega Valley)
"Has Petite Sirah's inky black color and strong, thick tannins, and is very dry, with blackberry flavors that could be a little more intense. Unless you like your red wines right out of the cradle, this one really needs cellaring through at least 2010.",Prospero 2006 Petite Sirah (Sonoma County)
"Shows the beautiful acidity and dry crispness that this bottling invariably displays. But this cool, unbalanced vintage has taken its toll, with a green unripeness to the citrus fruit that even the winemaker admits was significantly cooler than average.",Robert Mondavi 2006 To Kalon Vineyard Reserve Fumé Blanc (Oakville)
"Black pepper dominates the aroma of this wine, along with black currants, grilled meat and something sweetly spicy and exotic, like a teriyaki dressing. In the mouth, it turns softly sweet and candied. Drink now.",Ortman Family 2005 Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Soft, light, frothy apéritif style, pleasantly balanced with pear flavors. The aftertaste is soft, but the balance remains. Attractive, uncomplicated.",Mansard NV Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Dry and delicately structured, this is a high-acid, fairly austere wine. The flavors of tobacco, tart cherry skins and pepper will seem insufficient to fans of fruit-driven wines, but give this Dolcetto the right Italian-inspired fare, and it will shine.",Mosby 2006 Dolcetto (Santa Barbara County)
"Just a splash of Chenin Blanc has been added to the blend, adding some lift to the aromas and suggestions of citrus blossom. The natural herbaceousness of Sauvignon Blanc has been kept in check, but the wine is clean and varietal. The flavors seem just a bit muted, almost thin, but it's a perfectly refreshing, if simple effort.",Covey Run 2006 Quail Series Fumé Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A little tough and gritty, but with rich, forward flavors of berry and cherry jam, cocoa, clove and anise flavors. A Merlot-based Bordeaux blend.",Foxen 2005 Range 30 West Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Very soft, with low acidity and a texture as creamy as pudding, this Petite Sirah is made for early drinking. It's frankly delicious, with blackberry, currant, cherry, raspberry, chocolate and pepper-spice flavors that flood the mouth with opulence.",Ursa 2005 Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills)
"Edna Valley is a pretty chilly growing area, and you can taste the climate in the thick tannins and zingy acids that mark this Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's classic flavors of blackberries and currants, with notes of dried leather, tobacco, beefsteak and pepper.",Wolff 2006 Petite Sirah (Edna Valley)
"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",Zaca Mesa 2006 Grenache (Santa Ynez Valley)
"My bottle was sulfury on opening, but it blew off quickly. Then the wine revealed itself as very soft and somewhat simple, although dry. It shows modest flavors of ripe crushed summer blackberries and pepper.",Handley 2005 Handley Vineyard Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"A little green and minty, with sweet cherry, vanilla cream and smoke flavors brightened with crisp acidity. Drink now.",Brander 2007 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is a sweet, soft Port, with plenty of fruit. Sultana and orange jelly flavors are cut with some spirit. The wine leans much more towards fruit than wood, unusual for a 20-year old. The wine, like all aged tawnies, is ready to drink.",Messias NV 20 Anos Tawny  (Port)

"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough—and very fairly priced—to pop open with a midweek steak. The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable.",Tortoise Creek 2008 Cherokee Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"A cooler vintage in the Columbia Valley, which perhaps contributes to a wine that seems rather hard and thin. Though the alcohol is listed at 14.2%, the fruit is tight and one dimensional, with dominant acidity. The wine is sound and balanced, but not showing its best at the moment.",Trust 2008 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This easy Poggio Stella Merlot is redolent of black cherry, mature raspberry and currants. It's aged in oak casks for six months to add a playful touch of spice and toast. Pair this well-priced Italian wine with grilled sausage or meatloaf.",Vecchia Cantina di Montepulciano 2008 Poggio Stella Merlot (Cortona)
"Rich and ripe, with soft tannins and black plum flavors. It is round, while still having a core of attractive tannins. The fruit dominates, giving a friendly, accessible wine.",Alente 2007 Premium Red (Alentejo)
"Fresh, juicy wine, with soft tannins and taut red cherry fruit. The tannins provide a discreet backbone. Age for 2–3 years.",Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2010 JP Azeitão Tinto Red (Setubal)
"A sweet style of sparkling wine, with brisk acidity framing orange, lime, vanilla and honey flavors. Nice with wedding cake, at a good price.",Barefoot Bubbly NV Moscato Spumante Champagne Sparkling (California)
"With a few years in bottle, this is maturing well. It has ripeness, the tannins beginning to soften into rich spice and damson jelly flavors. The acidity is still very present as is the dry core.",Chateau de Launay 2005 Les Vignes de Julia  (Bordeaux Supérieur)
"This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now.",Cobblestone 2006 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A good, off-dry useful wine for drinking across the board with a wide variety of fare, or by itself as a cocktail. It's brisk and clean, with pleasant citrus, apricot, spice and vanilla flavors.",Dancing Derby 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A solid Zin for everyday drinking. A little rough and thin, but dry and spicy, with berry, currant and teriaki flavors.",De Loach 2009 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Melon and almond skin aromas lead to pithy citrus on what amounts to a pretty good bouquet. Round, citrusy and fresh in the mouth, with orange, passion fruit and tropical leanings. Solid and well shaped for a $7 quaffer. 70% Airen and 30% Macabeo.",Dominio de Eguren 2010 Protocolo Blanco White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Mint and milk chocolate are the lead aromas, followed by cherry and herbal notes. The wine is basic, fresh and fruity, with choppy tannins, heat and lively red berry flavors with citrus undertones. Runs a bit rough and heady.",El Escocés Volante 2009 La Multa Old Vine Garnacha (Calatayud)
"With three years' aging, this has developed into an almond- and toast-flavored wine that has softened and rounded the fruit. It has turned into a serious wine, its rich structure allied to the acidity. Ready to drink.",Domaine Roblin 2010 Ammonites  (Sancerre)
"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",Écluse 2010 Ensemble Lock Vineyard Red (Paso Robles)
"Right away you know this Syrah-Petit Verdot is a powerful wine. The bouquet is pointed and blasts away with cherry, berry, spice and oak aromas. It's thick, pushy and full-bodied, with minty, toasty oak flavors running side by side with blackberry. On the finish, it's more charred and toasty, with peppery spice and some heat. Drink now–2015.",Finca Constancia 2010 Syrah-Petit Verdot (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Sommeliers will appreciate this Chardonnay for its dryness and elegance, not to mention the price. It favors restraint over flamboyance, yet offers plenty of rich tropical and citrus fruits, with hints of honey and minerals. The alcohol is refreshingly balanced.",Bump 2011 Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley)
"Here's a gorgeous wine to pair with foie gras or pâté. A Riserva expression of Gewürztraminer, it opens with a bright golden color and segues to intense aromas of honey, candied peach, yellow rose, lemon curd and natural rubber. In the mouth, the wine is rich, opulent and long-lasting.",Cantina Cortaccia 2009 Brenntal Riserva Gewürztraminer (Alto Adige)
Here is a beautiful Pinot Bianco with aromas of melon and stone fruit that pop right out of the glass. This white variety is generally known for the richness of its mouthfeel more than its bouquet. But this expression excels on both the nose and in the mouth thanks to its intensity and purity.,Cantina Produttori Bolzano S. Maddalena/Gries 2011 Dellago Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Powerful and rich, this is a concentrated, wood-aged wine. It has toasted almonds as well as ripe pear and green-plum fruit. With a fine tension under the fruitiness, it will age over several years.",Château de la Roulerie 2011 Les Terrasses Chenin Blanc (Anjou)
"Full-bodied, fruity wine that has wood aging flavors along with red plum and strawberry fruits. Smoky, perfumed, this is a wine that shows fresh fruit with a good depth of flavor. Age for 2–3 years.",Château la Varière 2010 Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou Villages Brissac)
"A finely crafted, complex Cabernet that shows classic Napa construction. The tannins are very fine and the acidity balancing, while the flavors are rich in black currants, minerals and cedar. Drink now–2017.",ZD 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This wine shows the glamour you expect from a Phelps Cabernet. It's softly tannic and rich in blackberries, currants, licorice and cedar, with a lovely structure. Nice to drink now, right out of the bottle. Easy to find, with 17,300 cases produced.",Joseph Phelps 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a really good showing for the Garnacha Blanca grape. The bouquet is fresh and not the least bit blowsy, with an emphasis on apple and pear aromas. The wine is plump, fruity and showing modest acidity, while flavors of apple and baking spices precede a finish that's easygoing. Drink now.",Lafou 2011 Els Ameliers Garnacha Blanca (Terra Alta)
"As a whole, this is top-shelf Malbec with weight, character and complexities. It's also a touch gamy on the nose, with a no-miss blast of compost. Beyond that, the palate shows lemony oak and tight tannins on top of oaky, leathery flavors of robust berry and baked plum. Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.",Monteviejo 2008 Lindaflor Malbec (Mendoza)
"Ripe black currant aromas set this wine on its full, warm path. It is intensely fruity with a rounded feel to it. The acidity cuts through the ripe character, giving tension and a piercing crisp aftertaste.",Patient Cottat 2010 Anciennes Vignes  (Sancerre)
"Pécharmant produces some of the most dense reds of Bergerac, and this wine from Ancienne Cure shows some of the same character in a more fruity version. Black fruits and firm tannins are layered with forward acidity to give a wine that will be approachable this year.",Domaine l'Ancienne Cure 2011 Sélection Jour de Fruit  (Pécharmant)
"Initially youthfully crisp and herbaceous, the wine then broadens into riper more yellow-fruit flavors. That gives it richness and weight that balance with the grapefruit and lemon-juice freshness. Give this fine wine a year to meld together",Domaine Seguin 2011  Pouilly-Fumé
"You don't see much Syrah from the Veneto in northeast Italy, but Cicogna shows that the variety does have a future here. This expression is soft and plump with ripe fruit, blackberry, leather and tobacco. There's a point of bright freshness on the long finish.",Domenico Cavazza 2009 Cicogna Syrah (Veneto)
"Over the past few years, San Pedro has consistently put out excellent SBs under its 1865 label. This sings of coastal Chilean Sauvignon via mineral, passion fruit and grapefruit aromas. In the mouth, it's chiseled like a statue, with a mix of citrus and green flavors. Expect a cutting, crisp, zesty finish.",San Pedro 2012 1865 Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"With a depth of ripe cherry flavor, Sean Thackrey's Wentzel Clone 777, shows concentration and weight, with a riper, fleshier and bolder character than its clonal companions grown in the same vineyard block.",Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.",Tolosa 2011 Pure Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon.",Transcendence 2010 La Paloma Larner Vineyard Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Ripe, forward flavors of raspberries, cherries and cola mark this Pinot Noir. It's gentle in the mouth and nice and low in alcohol. Seems too soft for aging, so drink over the next 2–3 years with a great steak.",Alysian 2010 Floodgate Vineyard Rock Hill Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Shows good varietal character in a somewhat sweet format. It starts off slightly musky and gingery on the nose, then adds lychee fruit flavors. For its sweetness, it's not particularly richly textured or weighty, making it a possibility as an apéritif.",Grafen Neipperg 2006 Neipperger Schlossberg Auslese Traminer (Württemberg)
"This unusual dry Gewürztraminer puts the flavor focus squarely on grapefruit and pineapple, with a bone-dry acid underpinning. It has moderate concentration and length, with alcohol rated at just 12.5%.",Bonair 2007 Dry Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley)
"Thick and brawny, this Sicilian Shiraz boasts a deep purple hue and presents in-your-face aromas of prune, cedar, blueberry and white peppercorn. The consistency is chunky and chewy, like play dough, but drying mineral tones help cap those jammy fruit flavors.",Calatrasi 2005 Accademia del Sole Shiraz (Sicilia)
"Thick and luscious with deep oak tones and big cherry fruit flavors, this southern Italian red is a real fruit bomb with plush cherry intensity and ripe berry flavors. The strong sunshine has done its part to shape a thick, succulent red wine.",Cantele 2006 Amativo Red (Salento)
"Fresh black currant fruit gives this wine all the vivacity of the 2006 vintage. It is a beautiful, elegantly crafted wine, as you would expect from the same team as Château Ausone, and it has a lovely lightness of touch, with its final note one of delicious juiciness.",Château de Fonbel 2006  Saint-Émilion
"A wood-dominated wine that shows spice and high toast characters. It has probably seen too much wood in its aging, but there is fruit there, its black currant ripeness hiding in the background. Hopefully, the wood will soften and integrate.",Château Fonréaud 2006  Listrac-Médoc
"A touch funky and green at first, that soon blows off to reveal a dark and wonderfully concentrated wine that shows some serious promise with age. Cassis, plum, black cherry, spice and tobacco fill the palate, with a long, smoky finish sealing the deal. Drink after 2010. Imported by The Portfolio Group.",Château Maris 2005 Old Vine Syrah (Minervois La Liviniere)
"This is a very attractive wine with bursting cherry notes and vibrant layers of sweet spice and clove. You'll also get root beer, chopped herbs, tobacco and leather: the wine is thick and firm with oak-driven flavors.",Colli di Lapio 2005 Donna Chiara Campi Taurasini Aglianico (Irpinia)
"Moderately intense menthol, black licorice and African violets aromas on the nose. The mouth, full of ripe plum and dark cherries accented by notes of cocoa and fresh mint leaves, has a lovely balance and silky texture. Ends on a somewhat simple yet clean finish.",Domaine Lignères 2003 La Baronne Red (Corbières)
"Archetypal Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, featuring pungent, herbal aromas to go alongside bold passion fruit notes. It shows ample weight in the mouth, even a slightly oily texture and pronounced green flavors that persist a good long time. Probably best with fresh tomato or strongly herbal dishes.",Drylands 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Pleasant and melony on the nose, without the sharp, piercing aromas that sometimes push Chilean SB over the edge. New from the north of Chile, Elki is medium-bodied and generous, but not too angular. It's a whole wine with common citrus flavors as opposed to something demanding and sharp.Drink right away.",Elki 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Elqui Valley)
"Honey-sweet and direct, with citrus jam, apricot essence, crème brûlée and vanilla cream flavors. Fine with white cookies, lemon chiffon pie, pineapple sorbet.",Prager 2004 Madeline Riesling (Napa Valley)
"Fresh, fruity and charming, this rosé offers full-bodied flavors of strawberry and spice that are balanced and complex. A step above the typical flirty rosé, the wine gives style and substance and will handle heartier dishes—think Moroccan tagine or grilled, spiced fish.",Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Juanita Rosé Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson)
"This is a pleasantly intense wine with resiny aromas of tar, tobacco and smoked cedar wood. It has a dense, impenetrable personality and there are slightly bitter tannins on the close.",Salvatore Molettieri 2006 Cinque Querce Aglianico (Irpinia)
"Torre Pieve is a thick and creamy Chardonnay that is half aged in oak and half in stainless steel. These two methods give the wine structure and softness, but they also allow for the wine's natural fragrances to stay intact.",Santa Maria 2004 Torre Pieve Chardonnay (Veneto)
"Shaw and Smith's Sauvignon Blanc has become emblematic of the Adelaide Hills style, combining tropical fruit with a grassy streak, all framed by zippy citrus flavors. This would work equally as an apéritif or with various seafood dishes.",Shaw and Smith 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)
"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",Talley 2006 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Tedeschi's Ripasso offers unique aromas that recall forest berry, bramble, green spice and crushed bay leaf. It's a succulent and slightly sweet tasting wine with bursting fruit flavors and thick, chewy density.",Tedeschi 2005 Capitel San Rocco Red (Rosso del Veronese)
"Sweaty and pungent, loaded with overtones of crushed tomato leaf, this is an assertively herbal wine that requires careful food pairing, or a healthy preference for that style. It's not terribly weighty, but shows nice leafy complexity and a hint of curranty fruit. Try it with mussels steamed with lots of fresh herbs.",Mud House 2007 Swan Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
Here's a well-toasted red wine from Southern Italy that sees eight months of oak for added aromas of spice and tobacco. It has a sophisticated edge and loads of fresh fruit nuances at the core.,Fattoria Alois 2006 Cunto Pallagrello (Campania)
"Candied fruit and caramel ride on the back of maple syrup, allspice and ground ginger. Marsala is for much more than cooking and you can try this wine with aged cheese or as an after-dinner drink.",Florio NV Fine Sweet  (Marsala)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend is soft and ready to drink now. It's also very delicious, almost like a dessert pastry, with ultra-ripe black cherry, cassis, anise liqueur, melted milk chocolate and vanilla flavors that finish spicy-sweet.",Vice Versa 2005 Le Petit Vice Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Sonoma-Napa)
"Pungent, zesty and quite varietal in its expression. The nose is racy and intense, with nettle, sweat and passion fruit aromas. Expect a wet, almost spritzy palate with green-edged fruit flavors and light herbaceousness. There's bite and sass to this one, and the finish is quite long.",Viña Mar de Casablanca 2008 Reserva Especial Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Slightly funky and leesy on the nose, with somewhat sweaty overtones to the citrus and apple aromas. But the flavors are pure, suggesting that the aromatics just need some time to come around—or a quick decanting. It's medium in body, with a crisp, tangy finish that artfully balances sweet and tart.",Willi Haag 2007 Brauneberger Juffer Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Co-fermented with Viognier from the same vineyard, this is a lovely counterpoint to the big, bruising Barrister Bacchus Vineyard Syrah. Violets and chocolate dominate, with wild herb and cured meat flavors through the midpalate. Tannins are chewy and textured, with some stem and bark flavors.",Barrister 2006 Morrison Lane Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Minerally slate and sultry apricot and peach start this elegant white. A waxy palate and soft, feminine flavors of honeysuckle and flowers—as well as a burst of fruit—give the wine a rich but pretty character.",Brampton 2007 Viognier (Coastal Region)
"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate.",Cadaretta 2006 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dry, lean and structured, here is a wine that initially seems to be missing its fruit. There are hints of black cherries and plum skins, but they are always going to be surrounded by a heavy tannic presence.",Château Cos Labory 2006  Saint-Estèphe
"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity.",Château Teyssier 2006  Saint-Émilion
"Chatter Creek's value-priced Bordeaux blend is often his most appealing red wine upon release. This is scented with hard cherry candy, and the flavors follow right on course. It needs some breathing time to open out, and as it does, the finish lingers with pleasing streaks of coffee and toast.",Chatter Creek 2006 Blend 105 Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"One of Spain's great full-force, modern-style wines, this excels despite the marginal 2008 vintage. It's open-knit and soft on the nose, with ladels of spice, graphite and black fruit aromas. It feels fresh, balanced and not overly tannic, with strapping blackberry, coffee, chocolate, spice and tobacco flavors all rolled into a fabulous whole. Licorice, espresso and amaro notes grace the padded finish. Drink now–2018.",Maurodos 2008 San Román  (Toro)
"This is co-fermented Old Stones Vineyard and Cailloux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (60%) and Syrah (40%), showing the funk of the terroir and less of the varietal character of the fruit. It's flavorful and textural, with earth, anise and smoke notes, plus a mineral-driven wet-stone base and exceptional length.",K Vintners 2009 The Creator Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, this packs 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 13% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Refined and elegant, it is precisely structured, with a firm herbal attack and a perfect blend of berry and cassis flavors. It's dense, deep and compact, suggesting long aging ahead.",Pirouette 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A wonderful 100% Cabernet, this is Prime's first wine to bear the new Coombsville appellation. It's smooth, elegant and complex, with layers of blackberry and crème de cassis. It's beautiful now and over the next eight years.",Prime 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits—citrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.",Dunham 2010 Lewis Estate Vineyard Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is made from fruit sourced from the oldest block of Syrah in Washington, which was planted in 1986. The nose expresses complex varietal character, with a mix of blue and purple berry, a dusting of earth and accents of cinnamon and incense. Subtle and expressive, this is the best vintage to date for the Patriarche.",Betz Family 2010 La Côte Patriarche Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"One of the best Napa Cabernet Francs in memory, this shows lush, concentrated flavors of cherry pie, red currant, mocha, anise and smoky, spicy sandalwood that are wrapped into firm but exceptionally refined tannins. Drink now to experience the youthful beauty.",Constant 2009 Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",Signorello 2009 Padrone Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 Cask 23 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This delicious 100% Cabernet is supple and generous. The tannins are gentle, the acidity soft yet supportive of the structure, and as for the flavors, they go beyond satisfaction into sheer delight. They include blackberry, cherry, blueberry, currant, mocha and red licorice, but the wine has an earthiness and minerality that give it true complexity. This is Stag's Leap's most accessible 2009 Cabernet, easily earning its high score for sheer delight. Drink now–2015.",Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 2009 FAY Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This will be the last Ovide from En Cerise grapes. It's an explosion of cherry and milk chocolate flavors, remaining firm with expressive highlights of olive, earth and herb. It is two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, a perfect melding of the two grapes. Arguably, one gets better aromatics than Charles Smith, and the wine flavors deliver on their initial promise.",K Vintners 2009 En Cerise Ovide Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Co-fermented with 3% Viognier, this has a nice peppery lift. The fruit flavors seem less forward, with the herbal components much more front and center. It's made from a clone specific to the Cougar Hill Vineyard, showing cool climate flavors with subtle grace. Given a full 24 hours of breathing time, it opens further into a dazzling, rich mix of cherry and cassis that's soaked in an herbal broth.",K Vintners 2009 The Beautiful Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, crème de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.",Lamborn Family Vineyards 2008 Vintage VI Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic, this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak, plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release. Smooth as silk, it mixes berry, cherry and plum notes, with whiffs of smoke, green tea, and chocolate. Just past the stage of primary fruit flavors, it drinks beautifully, but can certainly be cellared for another decade at least.",Corliss Estates 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent, a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007, offering smooth and rich tannins, with elaborate blackberry, cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. New oak plays a dominant role, but it should recede as the wine integrates over time. Give it 6–8 years in the cellar.",Creō 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors, and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley—soft and herbal—but the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Put it in the cellar until at least 2018, and it could go far beyond that.",Goldschmidt 2007 Plus Single Vineyard Selection Vyborny Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"This classy Syrah opens with a note of pretty funkiness, wrapped around stiff, tight, rather herbal flavors. The berry flavor is ripe but in no way jammy. Here the emphasis is on nuance, earthiness and herbal details.",Gramercy 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. A dry, complex, multilayered wine, this will gain traction with 2–4 years in the cellar.",Marimar Estate 2010 Don Miguel Vineyard La Masía Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the “iron fist in a velvet glove” description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron. With smooth tannins and luxurious, oak-influenced blackberry and black cherry jam flavors, it's delicious now and will provide plenty of pleasure over the next 8–10 years.",Shafer 2008 Hillside Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"This is pure Cabernet—tight, tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit, rock, earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated, with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake.",K Vintners 2009 Stoneridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington)
"The vineyard straddles Atlas Peak and the Pritchard Hill region, and this beautiful Cabernet shows its terroir in the firm tannins and ripe, complex flavors. It's high in alcohol, which gives it some heat, and it is rich in flavors of blackberry and cherry jam and cassis liqueur. Give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink now.",Krupp Brothers 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Lush, plush and absolutely delicious, this shows a range of softly approachable flavors, including blackberry, cherry, currant, anise, cocoa, mineral, buttery oak and spice. The tannins are thick but finely ground. It's firmly set in the modern cult style and may not be an ager, but it sure impresses now.",Constant 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now, but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.",Hewitt 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"From the acclaimed Champoux vineyard, this puts the purple fruit in a wrap of pretty baking spices. Barrel aging adds cocoa and coffee, while the acidity is sufficient to keep the wine from feeling too tannic. Another couple of years of bottle age—or brisk decanting—should put it at its peak.",Sineann 2012 Champoux Vineyard Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Very rich, this ripe and rounded wine is typical of the powerful 2010 vintage. It's dense and concentrated, packed with black plum and sweet berry fruits. It shows a dense structure along with juicy fruits. It could be over the top, but the acidity and tannins hold it back. Drink from 2018.",Château de Ferrand 2010  Saint-Émilion
"A wine that is rich in both tannins and ripe fruit. The 45% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend gives the concentration of the wine, with spice and black berry fruits that are given an extra richness by the intense dark plums. The wine needs aging, so drink from 2018.",Château Haut-Logat 2010  Haut-Médoc
"Made from young vines, this is the second wine of Suduiraut. It has young, honeyed character, with a ripe, opulent texture that lays bitter orange fruits over drier noble rot flavors. It is so delicious now, but will be better from 2017.",Château Suduiraut 2010 Castelnau de Suduiraut  (Sauternes)
"This Syrah-based wine is dense, concentrated and seriously ageworthy. It is weighted by concentrated black fruit, with solid tannic structure and fine acidity on the finish. Drink after 2016.",Cortes de Cima 2011 Incógnito Syrah (Alentejano)
"Impressively concentrated for a Pinot Blanc, it offers intense spice as well as crisp apple flavors. It's bright, with good acidity as well as a rich and rounded aftertaste.",Domaine Ostertag 2013 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"Hugely ripe, this is a dense and potentially intense wine. Its high alcohol brings out a disturbing pepper character that spoils the purity of the rich fruits and mineral texture. It shows the heat of the volcanic soil of Ragen de Thann Grand Cru in its rich fruits and ripe structure. It does need aging, so drink from 2017.",Domaine Schoffit 2011 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Clos Saint-Théobald Riesling (Alsace)
"Not overly sweet, this offers a spicy character on top of a touch of honey and fresh lemon flavors. It's surprisingly and attractively delicate for a Gewurztraminer, and ready to drink now.",Domaines Schlumberger 2010 Kessler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Distinctive and generous, this white Rhône-style wine is made from Sierra Foothills grapes by a seasoned Napa winemaker. It tastes like vanilla, hazelnuts and pears, has a creamy texture, feels layered with fruit and spice notes, and has good acidity balanced by richness of flavor.",Elyse 2012 L'Ingenue Naggiar Vineyard White (Sierra Foothills)
"This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and—unusual for this variety in America—probably some oak influence. Rather full bodied, but well-balanced and very smooth, it combines peach and pear flavors with a hefty mouthfeel.",FEL 2013 Pinot Gris (Anderson Valley)
"A classic Napa Valley Chardonnay, this is smooth, rich, balanced and well composed. Flowery aromas of honeysuckle open the way for lemon curd and ripe apple to compete with a depth of crème brûlée character that provides plenty of complexity, with additional accents of honey and spice.",Franciscan 2012 Cuvée Sauvage Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Attractively priced, this Cab—with 5% Petit Verdot—offers meaty bacon and smoky oak character around sizable tannins, black currant, black licorice and a finishing dust of mocha.",Gibbs 2010 Obsidian Block Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.",Greyscale 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From a warm vintage, this blend is ripe yet still balanced, with aromas of prune, blackberry, tree bark and leather. The palate is saturated and broad, boasting flavors of dark, baked, black fruit accented by pepper and chocolate on the finish. Drink now.",Lapostolle 2012 Canto de Apalta Cellar Selection Red (Rapel Valley)
"Winemaker Anna Monticelli spent a harvest at Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux and worked under Philippe Melka at Seavey and Bryant Family. She leaves her own mark on this structured, silky, robust and rich Cabernet, bright in red cranberry and clove. Firehouse Vineyard is on the winery estate and given to floral and herbal notes, both of which suggest themselves slowly here.",Piña 2011 Firehouse Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This full-bodied wine offers classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, black cherry, leather and a whiff of baking spices. It's still young, delivering raspberry, clove, cinnamon and grilled herb framed by tightly woven tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2019.",Produttori del Barbaresco 2009 Pora Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"This is a modestly priced Napa Cabernet that's feral and brambly, the flavors well-composed and soft in black plum and black cherry. It's well balanced and structured, with ample tannins and length on the finish.",Renteria 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Warmed croissant yeastiness matches up with sea salt and lemon butter on the nose of this bottling from the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery. The salinity carries on the palate, with apple pie and butterscotch presenting a nicely oaked but not overdone palate.",Santa Barbara Winery 2012 Reserve Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Fruity frills of strawberry surround a core of black New Mexican chiles, with cinnamon and clove emerging the longer one sniffs. There's nice tension between the fruit flavors and the nearly bell pepper greenness. Throw a chill on it and serve with barbecued pork.",Still Waters 2010 Estate Cabernet Franc (Paso Robles)
"This is a delicious Chardonay. It dances in pear, peach and lemon notes. Balanced and addictive, it's easy to love and not overly complicated at all. Encased in just enough oak to provide texture and weight, this is a great wine for parties or casual dinners, pairable with just about anything.",Taken Wine Co. 2013 Complicated Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"A rich and medium sweet wine, full of spice, lychees and ripe fruits. There is a tangy texture, a strong sense of minerality as well as herb, yellow fruits and nutmeg flavors. It is still young and needs time. Drink from 2017.",Boeckel 2012 Zotzenberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"With rich melon aromas, ripe apple flavors and a soothing, almost soft texture, this wants some rich, sophisticated cooking to go with it, like sautéed fish with a classic French sauce. Subtle acidity keeps the notes of almond and apple lingering on the finish.",Wildhurst 2013 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Lake County)
"Aromas of cherry and vanilla continue to the palate alongside notes of toffee, smoked meat and roasted red pepper. A well-balanced wine, with flavors that are equal parts fruity and savory, the finish boasts lingering tannins and bright acidity. Fine Terroir Selections, Misa Imports.",Ixsir 2009 Grande Réserve Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon (Lebanon)
"Slightly funky scents of asphalt and sweaty socks come along with graphite, pressed blackberry and New Mexico chile. The palate is led by tobacco-laced zing, opening with boysenberry flavors, and finishing with decent acidity and mouth-coating tannins.",Mount Eden Vineyards 2010 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The Reserva version of Mural makes a powerful statement. Dark in color and packed with concentrated fruit, it is full of tannins as well as brooding black-plum flavors. Spice and juicy acidity complete the ensemble. It's a solid wine that needs to age to soften the tannic structure. Drink from 2017.",Quinta do Portal 2011 Mural Reserva Red (Douro)
"This wine is a fine exposition of the structure and density of a serious Douro wine. A field blend, it is packed with dark berry fruits and sweet tannins, with a strong mineral element that reflects the tough schist of the vineyards. It's drinkable now, but the wine will be better in 2016.",Quinta do Sagrado 2008 VT '08 Red (Douro)
"Made from a mix of vineyards across the Napa Valley, this pays tribute to the early days of grape growing in the region and is a wine equally worthy of recognition. Exhibiting dark cherry stone and wild strawberry aromas, the palate is complex, tannic and round, a subtle suggestion of smoke on the finish balanced by bright acidity.",Robert Biale 2012 Founding Farmers Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"This is a lightly aromatic wine, with notes of lees, apple, mineral and spice. It's medium bodied, with a thick, textured feel showing good weight and intensity to the fruit flavors alongside well-balanced acidity. A uniquely styled wine without an easy comparison in the region.",Savage Grace 2013 Celilo Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Coming in at 12.8% alcohol—nearly unheard of for a Washington red, particularly in a warm vintage—it brings appealing notes of dark plum accented by black pepper and dried herbs. It's silky soft in feel with a dazzling sense of texture and purity with little apparent oak influence.",Savage Grace 2013 Dineen Vineyard Malbec (Rattlesnake Hills)
"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit—supple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness.",Arbor Crest 2012 Five Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sanguine and brawny, it's concentrated in dark plum and blueberry fruit, with an earthy element teasing around the edges. The finish is marked by power and grip.",Genius Wines 2009 Creò Clajeux Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Chalk Hill)
"This vintage of the winery's Sauvignon Blanc doesn't reflect the tropicality that's started to define the region. It has more warmth to the nose than the grassy pungency common elsewhere, but the stronger differences are on the palate, with cooked apple, squeezed lemon and a brisk acidity, though not a particularly long finish. Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.",Happy Canyon Vineyard 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Quite why Smart Dog is a good name for a wine is a mystery. The wine itself a rich, soft Syrah with attractive ripe blackberry and plum flavors and soft, finely integrated tannins. It's an enjoyable wine that's ready to drink.",J. Portugal Ramos 2012 Smart Dog Syrah (Alentejano)
"An instantly enjoyable, balanced rosé. It's fresh, clean and full of red berry fruits, with a crisp finish. Drink now.",José Maria da Fonseca 2013 Periquita Rosé (Península de Setúbal)
"The nose on this dense wine opens with aromas of roasted coffee bean and toasted sensations. The concentrated palate offers espresso, chocolate, mature plum and vanilla alongside an infusion of brooding tannins.",Abbona Marziano 2010 Pressenda  (Barolo)
"Aromas of underbrush, espresso and toasted oak carry over to the palate along with raw red berry. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent tannins and racy acidity.",Bava 2010 Scarrone  (Barolo)
"Almost like a salad in your glass, this fresh-tasting, dry white wine smells like sugar snap peas and just-picked greens. It tastes snappy and crisp with parsley and thyme flavors, and has a refreshing texture.",Berryessa Gap 2013 Iberian Series Verdelho (Yolo County)
"Spunky, youthful aromas of wild berry and currant are aggressive but fresh in style. This is a juicy, forward, bright Malbec with boysenberry flavors followed by a short wave of bitter chocolate and toast. It finishes in the same style.",Bodega Norton 2012 Barrel Select Malbec (Mendoza)
"There is a strong barnyard aroma here, although the palate is cleaner and more modern. With rich tannins and a dark plum character, it's ripe and structured. There is a strong mineral element, giving the wine power and density. Drink from 2016.",Borges 2011 Lello Red (Douro)
"A tasty, lighter style of Pinot Noir, it offers fresh cherry and raspberry aromas, juicy fruit flavors and a delicate texture. There's enough complexity to keep you coming back for another sip.",Castle Rock 2012 Pinot Noir (Mendocino)
"This ripe wine opens with a fragrance of mature red and black berry, clove and black pepper. These carry over to the warm palate alongside brooding and tightly-knit tannins. It has a forward character and soft acidity so enjoy this now and over the next few years.",Taliano 2011 Ad Altiora  (Barbaresco)
"Plush and mouthfilling, this blend of Petit Sirah, Malbec, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Tinta Cão comes with notes of wild berries, cedar, flowers and spiced cocoa. Dusty, tongue-coating tannins keep the palate grounded.",The Infinite Monkey Theorem 2012 The Hundreth Monkey Red (Grand Valley)
"Expressive, honeyed white currant, banana purée and peach aromas give this blend of Viognier and Roussanne depth. The palate is smooth, lush and weighty, and it ends with some warmth and flower tones.",The Infinite Monkey Theorem NV The Blind Watchmaker White (Colorado)
"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torrontés. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torrontés that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.",Trivento 2013 Amado Sur Torrontés-Viognier-Chardonnay White (Mendoza)
"Graham cracker and lemon aromas weave into the brioche and porcini undertones. Graceful in weight, this bears a frothy bead that lends the palate tension. Aged on lees for 36 months.",Trump 2009 SP Blanc de Noir Brut Pinot Noir (Monticello)
"Raspberry and cherry aromas are juicy and wiry, with no fat at all. Pure, simple berry flavors come with a touch of spice, while the finish is short yet juicy. An easy-drinking and approachable selection.",Viña Albali 2012 Smooth Red Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"The wine is soft, rounded, showing light acidity and fresh fruit. Melons and pears dominate the ripe flavors, with a touch of almonds and rich aftertaste.",Château de la Vieille Tour 2013  Bordeaux Blanc
"The wine is all juicy fruit, black cherries with just a modicum of tannin to hold it together. It's fresh, ripe and immediately attractive. Ready to drink now, but with those tannins it should also age 2016–2017.",Château du Coudray Montpensier 2013 Le Grand Bouqueteau  (Chinon)
"This herbaceous wine is fresh, steely and crisp. Bright acidity cuts strongly through the lively texture, giving apples, lemon and pink grapefruit. Developing fast, it is ready to drink.",Château Lafont Menaut 2012  Pessac-Léognan
"It has attractive acidity and fragrant, juicy fruitiness. Underneath this fruit is a solid structure, fine tannins and fresh final acidity.",Château Simard 2011  Saint-Émilion
"Bold and fruity, this saignée-style rosé is 75% Syrah and 25% Pinot Noir. Tart, tangy, primary fruit flavors of watermelon, strawberry and cranberry fill the mouth, turning just a little bit sour in the finish.",Coeur de Terre 2013 Rustique Rosé (Willamette Valley)
"This crisp, clean Chardonnay is a good find for $20. Fruity with a suggestive note of caramel on the nose, it delivers a taste of citrus and green apple on the palate that evolves into a satisfying finish that's entirely tropical.",Decoy 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Snappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors. A zesty finish with mild citrus and nectarine flavors is par for the course.",Enanzo 2013 Garnacha Rosado (Navarra)
"This wine is heavily spiced from its wood aging. Fresher fruit flavors do come through to give black currants, bright acidity as well as firmer fruit structure. The wine still needs time, so drink from 2016.",Etienne de Tauriac 2010  Côtes de Bourg
"An amalgam of 85% Tannat, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this sports leather and blackberry aromas. The medium-bodied palate comes with tight, finely plaited tannins, and the boosted acids give the wine spine.",Fabbioli Cellars 2011 Tannat (Virginia)
"This white wine from Serbia has aromas of caramelized pineapple and elderflower. It is lively and energetic, with flavors of Japanese apple and ripe pineapple.",Milijan Jelić 2011 Morava (Pocerina)
"An unusual medley of aromas include orange peel, dill, mint, thyme, espresso and oak. The palate offers coffee, toasted oak and sugary vanilla but it doesn't have much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give a short, bitter finish that dries out the mouth.",Parusso 2010 Bussia  (Barolo)
"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",Pezat 2012  Bordeaux Blanc
"This starts off with promisingly vibrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit, but seems a bit weighty and thickly textured in the mouth. The fruit remains the bold centerpiece, while the finish shows some alcoholic warmth.",Plantagenet 2011 Hazard Hill Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Western Australia)
"There's a honeyed note to this wine, yet it's crisp in acidity, giving it a mouthwatering savoriness for drinking now. The flavors veer toward Asian pears, peaches and tart gooseberries.",Purlieu 2012 Le Pich Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Nice and dry, with some smooth tannins framing berry, cherry and oak flavors. Serve it at big parties, at the beach, wherever. Nobody will complain.",Robert Mondavi 2011 Private Selection Meritage (Central Coast)
"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",SuLei 2010 Les Collines Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"On the nose, this Cab delivers a mix of vinegar, rubber and jumpy berry aromas. The palate is smooth but bland and soft, while flavors of licorice, prune and herbal notes finish easy.",Valle Secreto 2010 First Edition Cabernet Sauvignon (Cachapoal Valley)
"Lots of early-drinking charm in this Pinot Noir. It's light and silky, with a modest alcohol level that makes it easy to drink. The raspberry, cherry, cola and oak flavors are delicious.",Laetitia 2011 Clone 113 Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"Scratchy berry aromas come with a hint of sweet-smelling plastic, but overall this bargain-priced Cab is good and welcoming. The palate has a pure, medium-bodied feel, while flavors of baked berry, cassis and chocolate finish with a mocha taste and mild heat.",Mancura 2011 Guardián Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Maray Chardonnay is crisp and mineral-driven on the nose, but not overly fruity. This is lean-bodied, with cidery, tangy acidity and dominating flavors of limestone-influenced citrus and stone fruits. It's a modest Chardonnay with finesse but not a whole lot of flavor.",Maray 2012 Limited Edition Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"This Bordeaux-style blend remains a fair value, showing some sweet barrel spices along with opening fruit flavors of red and black berry. It thins out in the middle and finishes with a simple, fruity flourish.",O•S Winery 2009 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Mint and eucalyptus flavors show strongly in this wood-aged, polished, smoky wine. The fruit suggests black plums, damsons and berries. Give the wine 3–4 years.",Jean-Michel Cazes 2011 Michel Lynch Bio  (Bordeaux)
"Hailing from the cool 2011 vintage, this Cabernet—which includes healthy doses of Malbec and Syrah—is light in style with notes of herbs and currant. With the oak (21% new American) dialed back, it's fresh and direct.",Waterbrook 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Chard's oak accents pineapple and lemon fruit flavors. It's dry yet honeyed, that paradox of Chardonnay, with a good burst of citrusy acids for brightness.",Wild Horse 2011 Unbridled Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Despite showing dusty plum and cherry aromas, this comes across lean on the bouquet, a defining characteristic that's confirmed on the palate via zesty, crisp acids and raw, tangy, herbal red-fruit flavors. A dry finish turns hot, an appropriate ending to this tightly wound Pinot Noir.",Errazuriz 2011 Max Reserva Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"This perfumed, juicy wine exhibts attractive red plum and blackberry flavors. Touches of herbs show a fragrant side to the wine, while acidity acts as a foil to the ripe fruits. Ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Fischer 2009 Classic St. Laurent (Thermenregion)
"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc isn't fully ripe yet it's dry and crisp, with a mouthwatering cleanness. There's an edge to the Meyer lemon, lime, green melon and vanilla flavors.",Baehner Fournier 2012 Vogelzang Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"An aromatically appealing wine with notes of cinnamon, chocolate and cherry. Unfortunately, it's quite tart with grainy, somewhat bitter tannins.",Canoe Ridge 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Despite cold conditions in 2011, this Pinot is dark in color and full on the nose, where heavy, raisiny black-fruit aromas hold court. Flavors of toasty oak, plum, berry and raisin finish peppery, oaky and with vanilla and prune notes. Drink now.",Casas del Bosque 2011 Pequeñas Producciones Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"In Spain, Albariño is usually a steely, bone dry, sea-inflected white wine. Here it is made in an off-dry style, with 10 g/L residual sugar. The sweetness masks any apparent varietal specificity, resulting in a pleasant, but generic white wine.",Castillo De Feliciana 2012 Albariño (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The winery doesn't tell us what the blend is, but it tastes vaguely Rhônish. It's dry, velvety and forward in cherry pie, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. It's a little hot in alcohol. Drink up.",Communication Block 2010 Lampyridae Vineyards Red (Mount Veeder)
"Minty aromas rest on top of scratchy raspberry scents. This feels a touch raw and choppy, with grating tannins pumping up herbal berry flavors that come with a carob-influenced aftertaste. A short, lightly herbal finish feels good and solid.",Emiliana 2011 Natura Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
Raspberry jam and oak are the flavors of this drink-me-now wine. Brisk acidity gives it a mouthwatering cleanness. The single-clone angle has resulted in a certain one-dimensionality.,Fess Parker 2011 Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"One of the classic, simple, attractive Grüners to come out of Austria, this brings forward lively green fruits, a touch of spice and crisp acidity. It's totally ready to drink. Screwcap.",Markus Huber 2012 Hugo Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"This is a soft, creamy, strawberry- and caramel-flavored wine with lively acidity and a very crisp, citrusy aftertaste. It's an ideal apéritif-style wine, perfect for the summer.",Markus Huber NV Hugo Rosé Sparkling Sparkling (Österreichischer Sekt)
"This straddles the border between an off-dry table wine and a dessert wine. It's crisp in acidity, with candied orange, golden apricot and honey flavors. You could certainly drink it with cookies and fruits, but it's just dry enough to stand up to squash baked with brown sugar, and a piece of grilled chicken.",Martin & Weyrich 2011 Allegro Moscato (California)
"This full-bodied Barbera has ripe black-cherry aromas nuanced with toast and coffee notes. The palate is structured, with dark fruit flavors, pepper, toasted oak and espresso notes, but the drying wood tannins result in an abrupt finish. Grape Expectations and Massanois Imports.",Pico Maccario 2010 Epico  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"This is a straightforward and pleasant Barbera exhibiting ripe dark-fruit flavors, spice and fresh acidity. Cries out for food, and will pair beautifully with soups, pastas and white meats. Grape Expectations and Massanois Imports.",Pico Maccario 2012 Lavignone  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Pinot Grigios like this helped make the variety one of America's most popular wines. While it's basically dry and crisp in acidity, it offers jammy green apple, lemon and lime Lifesaver candy and vanilla notes that appeal to consumers.",Robert Mondavi 2012 Private Selection Pinot Grigio (Central Coast)
"This is the inaugural vintage for this producer, a husband-and-wife team in partnership with winemaker Maayan Koschitzky, who also works with Philippe Melka. The vineyard-designate is lush and powerful, a full-bodied, tannic representative of an amazing growing year. Mint, black olive, blackberry and cigar highlight the sensual texture, enriched in dark chocolate.",Brilliant Mistake 2013 Taylor Family Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"There is something both earthy and berry fruited on the nose: both dried and fresh fruit shine with richness. There is a totally unusual, lovely bitter edge to this fruit, like a marzipan richness at the edge of tart but with ripe fruit. Take this into your treasure chest of vinous curiosities: It more than deserves its place. This is dry but rich, tart but generous, and comes with its very own strong and forceful personality.",Johanneshof Reinisch 2015 Satzing Rotgipfler (Thermenregion)
"Softened by 10% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this is a medium-bodied, elegant wine, with highlights of coffee, cedar and cherry-vanilla. Classic elements of cedar and dried herb complement firm, solid tannin.",Les Belles Collines 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Candied cranberry and grape meet with light nutmeg, gingersnap cookies and wet slate on the rich, interesting nose of this wine by Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is power-packed and spicy, with boysenberry, sandalwood, cedar, incense, star anise and black-tea touches.",Loring Wine Company 2015 Sierra Mar Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Rhubarb, ripe cherry and wet slate show on this wine, one of the many higher-end, single-vineyard expressions that winemaker Paul Clifton makes for the Hahn family. Hearty beet juice and lots of star anise show on the sip that is redolent with dark, wild berries.",Lucienne 2014 Hook Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Baked black cherry, rare roast beef and light sage aromas show on the dynamic, earthy nose of this bottling by Winemaker Paul Clifton. Garrigue is prominent on the tip of the sip, with strong but not overripe black cherry and plum flavors. These lead into forest floor, juniper, pine needle and mulling spice on the finish.",Lucienne 2014 Smith Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Concentrated, well structured and not too full bodied, this is an almost architectural wine in how it fills out the palate and clings to the taste buds. It has an appetizing texture due to fine-grained tannins, a sense of ripeness without overripeness, plus deep and layered fruit, coffee and black-pepper nuances.",Lynch Wines 2013 Strummer Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"From a block planted in 1910 consisting of hearty portions of mixed blacks, this wine is abundantly floral in rose petals, with a plummy core dusted in smoky oak. The tannin structure is sizable, while the wine is full of leather, cigar box and black pepper accents that weave within the ripe fruit.",Armida 2014 Tina's Block Maple Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"There are a number of intriguing notions on the nose: There is something nutty and rich, something mellow and yeasty, something green and lively, all tinged with the juicy ripeness of yellow-stone fruit. Not one of these impressions dominates, all of them catch your attention in a merry haze of flavors delivered against a firm backbone of freshness and concentration.",Bernhard Ott 2015 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram)
"Named after the medieval rulers of the village, this cru wine is firm and structured in the solid style of the appellation. It has rich black cherry and black-plum fruits that come with juicy acidity. At the same time, the tannins and the dry core promise considerable aging. Drink from 2019.",Trenel Fils 2015 Les Capitans  (Juliénas)
"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous.",Wolff 2014 Old Vines Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"The nose is tightly closed, yet there is the suspicion of fine fruit. The grippy palate brims with peppery dark-plum fruit and very fine distinct tannins that give this a taut, rigid frame that still needs to relax. This is unusual in so far that it is a Cabernet Franc from Austria, grown on slate. It works well: The tannic structure and fruit are fully expressed. This needs bottle age and will blossom into a far more relaxed and fruitful wine. Drink 2020–2030.",Gunter Triebaumer 2014 Gillesberg Cabernet Franc (Burgenland)
"This sultry, big-boned wine offers deft aspects of black pepper and dried herb atop a softly layered touch of brown sugar. Richness is there, as is a voluptuous flirtatiousness, yet it remains dry and dusty on the palate and classically varietal.",Haraszthy 2013 Indian Springs Ranch Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Very subtle notions of nettle and ripe, yellow mirabelle plum play on the nose. The palate displays the same juicy notions and bounces with the ample fruit of 2015, tempered by spicy grapefruit zestiness. This offers a wonderful interplay of ripeness and just the right amount of refreshing tartness.",Hiedler 2015 Ried Schnekenbichl Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"The Okanagan has the capability to produce delicate, almost ethereal Pinot Noirs, and this fine example proves the point. Fragrant and feminine, its strawberry and cherry fruit ripe enough to suggest fresh pastry, it's simply delicious, offering complexity and persistence as well as immediate enjoyment.",Burrowing Owl 2014 Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"Owned by Beaune merchant Louis Jadot, this cru estate produces some impressive wines. While its alcohol is excessive for a Beaujolais, it wears its power well. The black plum fruit and tannins from wood aging that are still very present will soften over the next year to give a rich generous wine with a style that is Burgundian rather than traditional Beaujolais. Drink from 2018.",Château des Jacques 2015 Côte du Py  (Morgon)
"Initially this smells foxy, with jumpy untamed berry and plum notes racing across the nose. After the aromas come around, this is hard and choppy on the palate, while herbal black-plum and carob flavors finish more lushly than before, but still fairly tannic. Drink through 2023.",Concha y Toro 2013 Don Melchor Puente Alto Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Puente Alto)
"The northernmost of the Beaujolais cru villages can produce wines that are Burgundian in their structure. This wine fits that profile well with its dark tannins and rich concentration. Densely textured with both black-cherry fruit and a dry core, the wine is taking its time to develop. Drink from late 2017 or 2018.",Domaine des Chers 2015 Vieilles Vignes  (Saint-Amour)
A touch of passion fruit haunts the nose. The palate is juicy with mirabelle plums and lively lemon and orange notes. There is zesty textured concentration and a wonderful purity of flavor. This is exciting and has lots of drive with a lip-smacking finish.,Forstreiter 2015 Schiefer Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"Dark, dense with fruit flavor and thickly tannic, this full-bodied wine is a monument to concentration, ripeness and richness. Massive tannins are matched by huge jammy fruit, with a sense of layering and depth that is impressive and satisfying to experience.",Freakshow 2014 Red (Lodi)
"A blend of Syrah (68%), Grenache (29%) and Viognier, this wine brings pungent, directly appealing aromas of smoked meat, blue fruit, black olive, orange peel and high-toned flowers. The blue and black-fruit and smoked-meat flavors are silky and well constructed with a finish that lingers.",Gård 2014 Vaucluse Lawrence Vineyards Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The producer sources from three sites, each vineyard-designate worthy: Cleary Ranch and Rayhill Vineyard in Freestone, and Stiling Vineyard in Russian River Valley. Together they sing, coaxing spicy white pepper and clove from the grapes while a velvety texture of firm tannin provides support. Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors.",Blue Rock 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Made from 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this has inviting aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, forest floor and a whiff of cedar. The dense, polished palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove, licorice and tobacco. Firm, refined tannins provide support.",Brancaia 2012 Ilatraia Red (Toscana)
"It's rare to see varietal Carmenère outside of Chile, let alone in Long Island, and such a great surprise when it's as tasty as this. It's lusciously fruity yet pristinely fresh, boasting crisp black-plum and cherry flavors that penetrate deeply on the palate. A herbaceous swathe of green leaf and bramble only accentuates the freshness. Fine firm tannins need a few years to meld. Hold until 2020.",Osprey's Dominion 2013 Carmenère (North Fork of Long Island)
"The producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color. Meat, black pepper, leather and tobacco give it a velvety lushness and concentration buoyed by complex, savory components. The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.",Gundlach Bundschu 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors. A ripped finish is dry and oaky now, with core fruit resting for the future. Drink 2018–2028.",Koyle 2013 Royale Los Lingues Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"The merest touch of apricot caresses the vanilla and hazelnut notes of fine oak. The palate, on the other hand, conveys power and concentration, held tight and taut by lemon freshness. This will take a little while in bottle to unfold and should entice lovers of Chardonnay with its combination of bright freshness and lush fruit.",Anton Bauer 2015 Kreuzgang Chardonnay (Wagram)
"A savory rather than fruity blend of 60% Syrah and 40% Grenache, this bottling offers black pepper, anise and light violet alongside boysenberry and elderberry fruit on the nose. The palate tightens up into underripe cherry, thyme, marjoram and bay leaf, with very dry elderberry fruit tones.",Baker & Brain 2013 Pendulum Red (Monterey County)
"Handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot figure into this wine, a lovely, medium-bodied beauty that finds balance in its measured use of oak. Vanilla, plum and bold jolts of pepper and cinnamon combine well on the lengthy palate.",Ballentine 2014 Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley)
"A curious mix of roasted smokiness and red fruits makes for an appetizing autumnal nose. The red fruit underneath these flavors is beautifully pure and speaks of raspberry and wild strawberries. The wonderfully refreshing tartness zips across the palate like a bright streak of light and gives freshness, direction and poise to everything. The flavors are lasting and long.",Bründlmayer 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Niederösterreich)
"A rich, opulent wine at an unbelievable price, this Chard has layers of ripe peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and a lush overlay of toasty oak. The wonderfully creamy texture leads to a long, spicy finish. Despite the statewide appellation, this is as good as many regional Chardonnays.",Esser Cellars 2001 Chardonnay (California)
"This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot is young, rambunctious and tight, but also very interesting. The aromas of chocolate, clove, pepper and black plum do the trick: you are drawn in. Intense flavors of cherry, plum, cassis and pepper, and a finish of piquant spices and oak are equally satisfying. Based on how this wine responded to air we say give it a few years to settle down.",Cana's Feast 1999 Red (Red Mountain)
"This is a very modern style of wine, with generous new wood and super-ripe fruit flavors, balancing with polished solid tannins. Very international in style, it is good, but could come from anywhere.",Château Pontet-Canet 2000  Pauillac
"This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape.",Clos Fourtet 2000  Saint-Émilion
"Medium and smooth in the mouth, Jacob's Creek's top Chard (check?) has stone and star fruits at its core, and a sleek mineral quality. Creamy on the nose, but with a lively lime streak that keeps it crisp. Finishes medium-long with drying minerals.",Jacob's Creek 2000 Limited Release Chardonnay (Padthaway)
"Two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Though this 2006 vintage was held back for some time to allow for extra bottle age, this is still a hard, tannic wine that requires decanting. The build-out is well done, tannins firm and moderately ripe, fruit flavors Bordeaux-like. Right now it's a bit monolithic, tasty enough, but without the textural interest that most Abacela wines display.",Abacela 2006 Claret (Southern Oregon)
"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",Babcock 2009 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A steal for six bucks; the nose is floral and black, but under control. Meanwhile, the palate is bouncy, round and balanced, with juicy black plum and wild berry flavors. Clean and solid.",Borsao 2009 Viña Borgia Grenache (Campo de Borja)
"Very bright and acidic, with the savory taste of a sour lemondrop candy. If you're sensitive to acidity you'll find it tart. But it's deliciously layered, with tiers of buttered toast, vanilla and spice.",Brophy Clark 2008 Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast.",Carmel Road 2008 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"You'll really love this simple and clean white wine from sunny Tuscany. The aromas here are crisp and fragrant, recalling peach, apricot and pear. The wine is zippy in the mouth but it also awards enough natural structure for tuna or sushi.",Castello Montaúto 2008  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"The 2007 Hickinbotham features attractive scents of ground spices, leather and red cherries, but doesn't seem to have the richness and depth of CH's other Grenaches this year. Tart cherry-berry fruit fades into finely textured tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",Clarendon Hills 2007 Hickinbotham Grenache (Clarendon)
"Hints at cedar, spice and dark fruit on the nose, then turns unexpectedly tart on the palate. The tannins are soft, leaving the acidity to provide a counterbalance to the ripe fruit. Drink now.",D'Arenberg 2008 The Custodian Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"Bright fruit freshness dominates this wine. The fruit is pure, vivid. light and crisp. The acidity is important here, driving the wine in a mineral direction.",Domaine Specht 2008 Pinot Blanc (Alsace)
"A solid, straightforward, all-purpose Pinot Gris, this offers firm and spicy pear and apple fruit, some crisp phenolics giving it a racy edge, and a little bite to the back of the palate. It has the acidity to stand up to creamy pasta sauces or soft cheeses.",Evergreen Vineyards 2008 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Black pepper is the star of this bone-dry, full-bodied young wine, in both the aroma and the flavor. Below that are bold notes of black currants, plums and leather. The tannins are hard, giving it a mouth-stinging astringency. Your best bet is to cellar it for 3–4 years, but it's somewhat risky.",Fess Parker 2007 Rodney's Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Light strawberry and black cherry fruit is the story here, backed with decent acidity. Tannins are dark and well-structured, so the wine keeps its balance. Though it does not have the weight or depth of Washington Syrahs, or the sweet berry flavors of California, it is soundly made, drinking well, fruit forward, and a good choice for warm weather sipping.",J. Scott Cellars 2007 Del Rio Vineyard Syrah (Rogue Valley)
"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit. Yes, there's a hard, burnt element to the wine, but this being Pinot Noir from Penedès that's to be expected.",Juvé y Camps NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cava)
"Light, young vine fruit flavors mix strawberry and rhubarb, with a tangy, citrus component underscoring the midpalate. It gets a little more interesting in the finish, which brings in seed flavors and a lingering, orange juicy aftertaste.",Luminous Hills 2008 Estate Grown Pinot Noir
"Crisp, natural and lightly salinic on the nose, with medium weight, good freshness and solid peach and citrus flavors. This is a standard but nicely done Rioja rosé with a pithy finish and just the right edge to it. Drink liberally with appetizers and you shouldn't go wrong.",Marqués de Cáceres 2009 Rosé (Rioja)
"Uccelliera regularly produces powerhouse Brunellos. This Rosso evidently represents a change of pace because instead of power and intensity, you get ethereal aromas of wild berry and green spice. There's also an unexpected touch of sour cherry on the close.",Uccelliera 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"A good, dry Cabernet whose fruit flavors are balanced with rich tannins. Offers upfront flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and cocoa. Good price, considering the elegance",Valley of the Moon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.",Villa Andretti 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"This is a gorgeously perfumed Riesling, chock-full of white flowers and ripe, juicy stonefruit, but not at all cloying. Dry on the palate, it exhibits elegant peach and apricot flavors that lead to a long, lingering finish marked by lime peel and a hint of chalk.",Wagner 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Harvested at 22.6 degrees brix, this bright and spicy Dolcetto does not reach too far. It's tart, with fruit flavors that suggest wild berries and pomegranate, and tannins that are firm but never green. A fine quaffing wine.",Abacela 2008 Dolcetto (Umpqua Valley)
"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",Bodegas San Prudencio 2007 Envite Crianza  (Rioja)
"Even for a Mount Veeder Cab, this one's pretty tannic. It also seems very oaky, with lots of caramelized, charred wood. Somewhere underneath it all are blackberries and black currants that are sweetly ripe. Your best bet is to cellar it, but its future is uncertain given the initial irregularities.",Brandlin 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"There's a meaty, ripe aspect to the aromas here that recall black cherry and smoked ham. But there's also an edgy green tone that lends a slightly bitter impression in the mouth.",Canneta 2005  Brunello di Montalcino
"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",Cathedral Ridge 2008 Necessity Red Red (Columbia Valley (OR))
"Bright and woodsy, this Syrah-dominant red is intriguing for its tapestry of earth and mushroom flavors interwoven with mixed berry fruit. There's enough acidity in the medium, yeast-scented finish to stand up to hearty red meats. Drink up.",Domaine Saint Andrieu 2007 Red (Côtes de Provence)
"Typical light and fresh Grüner, with an attractive burst of lemon acidity as well as a creamy texture. Delicious, crisp wine. Screwcap.",Domäne Wachau 2009 Terrassen Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"A blend assembled from several vineyards, Kumeu River's 2010 Estate Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, plushly textured wine. Toast and citrus aromas lead the way, followed by flavors that hint at creamed corn and plenty of vibrant pineapple. Drink it over the next few years.",Kumeu River 2010 Estate Chardonnay (Kumeu)
"This Pinot bears only the simple regional Carneros appellation, but it has the rich texture and complex flavors of a vineyard-designated wine. Absolutely delicious, with raspberry, red cherry, mocha and red-licorice flavors that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. Drink this lovely wine over the next few years.",Renteria 2010 Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"A wonderfully drinkable Pinot Noir, this wine shows the brisk acidity and long hangtime flavors of the Sonoma Coast. The fruit got exceptionally ripe, so the raspberries, cherries and persimmons are as sweet as jam. Yet the finish is dry and firm.",Renteria 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Still young, hard and sharp-edged, the wine reveals dark flavors of charred toast and espresso, set around a core of tight cranberry and raspberry fruit. It's built to age, and has some pleasing mocha and spice notes rounding out the finish.",Rex Hill 2011 Jacob-Hart Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This structured wine opens with quintessential Sangiovese aromas of violet and black berries punctuated with whiffs of leather and balsamic herbs. The palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with mint, black pepper and licorice notes that add depth. The hint of prune on the finish reflects the warm, challenging vintage, but this is a delicious, well-balanced wine. Enjoy soon. Soilair Selections, Vineyard Road, WineCraft.",Riecine 2011  Chianti Classico
"This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.",Rutherford Hill 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Rich, soft, ripe and juicy, this Cab shows all the hallmarks of the modern cult style. It's incredibly lavish in oak, blackberry pie, cassis liqueur and licorice flavors, and should drink well for the next six years.",Stewart 2011 Hollis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"With its violet, berry, spice and leather sensations, this savory blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot displays the quintessential perfume of a youthful Chianti Classico.

"Rich in wild cherry, raspberry, black cherry and white pepper, this delicious wine offers all the juicy fruit, freshness, minerality and supple tannins that make a young, well-made Morellino so attractive.

"With oak-based aromas of Graham cracker, vanilla and baked berries, this comes across as being ripe and generous. Baked black fruits, ample oak, mocha and vanilla are the key flavors, while the finish is woody and medium long. Drink now.",Durigutti 2011 Malbec (Mendoza)
"A fruity wine, it's packed with citrus, freshly peeled apples and white peaches. Acidity cuts through the ripeness, giving total freshness at this stage. It's a wine to be drunk for its fruitiness now, or aged until 2018 for more complex flavors.",Château Moncontour 2012 Sec  (Vouvray)

"Accolades to the winery for holding this wine back longer than most wineries dare to. It's just beginning to soften and develop bottle nuance, but is still marked by ripe raspberries and cherries. It's really lovely now, with brisk acidity brightening the fruit, and should continue to mellow over until 2020.",En Garde 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Made with Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this wine begins with typical Sangiovese aromas of tilled soil, leather, spice and ripe berries. The structured palate delivers dark cherry layered with black pepper, clove and cinnamon alongside solid tannins and fresh acidity. It's starting to show tertiary flavors of flint and fig but will maintain well for another few years at least. Drink through 2018.",Fattoria di Montemaggio 2008  Chianti Classico
"This is a woody, oak-dominated Malbec, but it's also ripe and well made. Aromas of sawdust, vanilla and toast support raw berry essence. In the mouth, tartaric notes stick out amid the richness, while flavors of oak, toast, vanilla and berry fruits finish woody but with wayward acidity.",Finca la Celia 2011 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley)
"A full, fruity wine, it is ripe and finely textured. It also has a good chalky, mineral character, rich apple and grapefruit flavors and tight, dense acidity. It should be aged until 2015.",François Millet 2012 Domaine des Côtes Blanches  (Sancerre)
"Dr. Loosen offers a solid value in this remarkably well-priced eiswein. It's enticing on the nose, with aromas of honey, saffron and a dark, dusty mineral tone. Rich and silky in texture, it's concentrated and lively on the palate, with intense flavors of lemon and peach. Finishes with a tinge of tea and spicy orange rind. It's delicious now, but should develop well through 2020.",Dr. Loosen 2009 Eiswein Riesling (Mosel)
"So bright and zingy in acidity, and so ripe in tangerine, mango, lime fruit and honeysuckle, that you hardly notice the oak influence. Yet, it's there in the form of buttered toast. The result is a big, powerful Chardonnay, clean and vibrant, for drinking now with dramatic shellfish and pork dishes.",MacRostie 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This early peek at Margerum's 2012 Rhône-style red wines holds the promise of future great releases from the acclaimed vintage.

But the smoked meat and black pepper notes belong to Syrah.",Raymond 2010 Small Lot Collection Syrah (Napa Valley)
"Fragances of wild berries, bramble and honeysuckle pave the way for flavors of cherry cola, toffee and tangerine zest.

"Perfumed with notes of blossom, ripe stone fruit and citrus, this is a lush, slightly honeyed, dry Silvaner. Brisk and bright with lime acidity, it finishes with just a hint of varietally characteristic grass and smoke.",Thörle 2012 Saulheimer Kalkstein Trocken Silvaner (Rheinhessen)
"Rich and full-bodied, this displays much of the complexity of a Grand Cru wine. It also has a strongly fruity character that bursts from the glass.

"From a highly sought-after source of Cabernet, this is classically oaky and dusty, a sophisticated take on the grape, dense and soft in waves of black cherry.

"Sourced from a so-called “mystery clone” that may have originally arrived in Charles Coury's suitcase back in 1964, this unique old-vine bottling offers exceptional details of dusty cocoa, baking spices, cola, minerals and iron filings. The brambly berry fruits are not at all overwhelmed, just balanced out with the structure for aging. Drink now through 2025.",Hyland 2012 Coury Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"Just one barrel was made of this reserve.

Which is plenty, adding just enough sweet and toasty vanilla to the extended, rich finish.",Willamette Valley Vineyards 2012 Elton Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"VM takes a huge leap in the Syrah race with this wine. It's inky purple in color, with hints of pepper, espresso and black olive accenting blueberry and blackberry fruit.

It's very well measured.",Michael Gill Cellars 2012 Tantrum Tempranillo (Paso Robles)
"The second vintage of this wine comes from a great Douro year. It gives structure, dark fruits and a serious tannic structure that has been rounded by wood aging. Spice, berries and mint flavors all contribute to this powerful, ageworthy wine. Drink from 2017.",Muxagat 2011 Cisne Red (Douro)
"Still young and firm, this wine gives indications of potential fruitiness along with a structure that promises concentration.

Delicious now, but should hold together nicely for another couple of years.",Southern Right 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Walker Bay)
"At first, a rush of front-loaded plum and blackberry fruit hits the palate, then the flavors seem to sag a bit entering the midpalate. A wall of still-to-be-resolved oak leads into a hard, astringent, somewhat woody finish.

"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust.

"Bright, vivid and sizzling on the nose, then zesty, tight and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned plum, berry and red currant flavors offset by a touch of milk chocolate. Long on the finish, but not that nuanced or complex.",Nuna 2010 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"Strawberry and other red-fruit aromas run the bouquet. The palate is tangy and crisp, with dry but clean red-fruit flavors. Mildly spiced on the finish, this has length and purity. A very good quaffer.",Ochoa 2011 Rosado Garnacha Rosé (Navarra)
"Like many of the Perrin & Fils wines, this one is firmly structured, its cherry and cocoa flavors ending on a dusty, tannic note.

"This shows that apricotty, botrytised aroma and flavor often found in Santa Lucia Chardonnays from the cooler parts of the appellation, but it's not at all sweet. Instead, it's a bone-dry wine, with vibrant acidity.",Lucia 2010 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)

"Leathery, earthy aromas don't seem entirely fresh, but they are solid and don't waiver. Full bodied, with coarse tannins and roasted red-berry, tomato and herb flavors.

"This shows the greenish scent of conference pear peel and its juicy, tart but ripe flesh. After up-front fruit, it refreshes with a superlight, lemony-fresh body. If you are looking for featherlight refreshment, the Grüners from the 2014 vintage will deliver zippy fruit.",Allram 2014 Strassertaler Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)

"This wine was barrel-aged for 36 months and saw additional time in bottle prior to release. It displays brooding aromas of vanilla, cranberry, cherry, woodspice and light meaty notes. The palate is densely packed with tart cranberry flavors backed by firm, somewhat dry tannins.",Flying Dreams 2011 Reserve Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dark and earthy in style, this wine's plum and black cherry fruit is framed by firm tannins and a base of wet stone. Give it another year or two in the cellar and see if it loosens up.",Greenhough 2011 Hope Pinot Noir (Nelson)
"Green melon, lime and lemon flavors ring fresh and pure in this unoaked Chardonnay. It's anchored by a bracing backbone of acidity, but the palate builds in richness and mouthfeel, finishing on a riper, slightly tropical fruit note.",Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Cedar, tobacco and dried-berry aromas are mature and spicy. This shows preserving acidity and flavors of caramel, baked berries and spice. It lasts long on the finish; drink now.",Hollen Family Vineyards 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"From one of the most famous Pinot blocks in Marlborough, this wine delivers slightly more fruit intensity and textural richness than Giesen's The Brothers bottling. It still shows mossy, mushroomy complexity allied to cherry fruit, then finishes crisply, with mouthwatering acids. Drink now–2018.",Giesen 2011 Clayvin Single Vineyard Selection Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Medium-intense scents of raspberry and red cherry lead the bouquet of this wine, while hints of curing spice and vanilla bean dance in the background.

Flavors are rich, hedonistic and sweet, supported by firm, somewhat rustic tannins.",Castillo De Feliciana 2011 Reserve Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))

"At less than $30, this entry-level beerenauslese is an exceptional value. Savory and sweet play hand-in-hand on the nose and palate, balancing notes of dried herb and with unctuously sweet orange and pear. Dusty saffron and herb tones are quite pronounced on the palate, but the finish is vibrant, with hints of lemon and tangerine zest.",Leonard Kreusch 2009 Estate Bottled Beerenauslese Riesling (Rheinhessen)

"A mélange of Sangiovese, Primitivo, Barbera and Dolcetto, this wine offers a rustic personality harking back to the old country from whence all these varieties originally hailed. Big in structure and presence, the wine has more earthy, savory components than rich fruit and is sparse on the finish.",Brutocao 2010 Quadriga Red (Mendocino)
"This is a style of Pinot Noir that needs to be drunk chilled. It brings out the smoky, stalky character of the wine that dominates the bitter cherry fruits. It's still young and needs another year to come together.",Chavet Fils 2012 Tradition  (Menetou-Salon)
"Effusive aromas of lychee, lemon drop and orange blossom mark the nose of this Malvasia. Medium in body, this has a bright, floral palate that would pair well with citrus-marinated grilled swordfish.",Arizona Stronghold 2011 Site Archive Norte Malvasia (Cochise County)

"Brown sugar and buttered toast flavors dominate this wine, but it's not cloying, because it has lots of acidity. The mango, tangerine and peach flavors testify to exceptional ripeness.",San Simeon 2012 Chardonnay (Monterey)
"Tropical in scent, this is an easygoing, medium-bodied wine that is laced with bright acids. Baked cod doused with lime would make a solid pairing.",Tarara 2012 Viognier (Virginia)
"Some unripe flavors suggest green mint and asparagus. They limit the score, despite some good blackberry tea, currant and white-pepper flavors. Drink up.",V. Sattui 2011 Crow Ridge Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of oak, rubber and unusual sensations that recall petrol. There's more oak than fruit on the palate, delivering toasted oak, espresso, vanilla and coffee alongside hints of black cherry. It closes on an astringent, tannic note.",Valiano 2008 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Mature berry aromas carry a strong sidenote of raisin. This Tempranillo from the Granada area is tightly wound, with crisp, dry flavors of prune, vanilla and raw oak. Overall this seems a bit cooked and past its prime.",Villagrán 2007 Cortijo de Balsillas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra Altiplano de Sierra Nevada)
"A powerful and concentrated blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Aragonez. Solid blackberry flavors give the wine strength, while tannins and hot pepper bring out bitterness and spice. It's not a wine for the faint-hearted.",Herdade da Gâmbia 2011 Red (Península de Setúbal)
"The main taste impression of this superripe Cabernet is of chocolate-covered raisins. Then the even riper notes of prunes emerge. The alcohol, which is 15.7% by volume, gives the finish a glyceriney sweetness. It will satisfy die-hard fans of this Napa style, but it's hard to see this clumsy wine developing in the bottle before the fruit crashes.",Ideology Cellars 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Ripeness was no problem in this wine, despite the chilly vintage. It bursts with raspberries and cherries, with brown sugar and oak richness. Gentle enough to drink now, the blend is Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order.",Kokomo 2011 Claret (Dry Creek Valley)

"Ripe Alvarinho gives a wine that is rich as well as crisp and dry. This wine, with its hints of apricot as well as citrus fruits has a piercing line of acidity along with the tangy texture and ripe aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",Aveleda 2015 Alvarinho (Vinho Verde)
"This Hungarian white has aromas of peach, apricot, citrus blossom and vanilla bean. In the mouth, there are flavors of caramelized apple and wet river rock.",Basilicus 2012 Once Upon a Time White (Tokaj)
"Estate-grown, though it is not indicated on the label, this matches black raspberries to a lightly toasty frame. The wine spent just under a year in French oak prior to bottling. The fruit and oak components are in good proportion, but another year or two in bottle will help to meld the flavors.",Björnson 2014 Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Spicy, medicinal cherry, tomato and herb aromas lead to a palate with rubbery tannins and moderate astringency. A fresh and tasty mix of spicy, rooty berry flavors ends with brushy, herbal, chocolaty notes on the finish.",Bodega Chacra 2015 Barda Pinot Noir (Patagonia)

"French oak, a whiff of exotic spice and a buttery note lead the nose. The oak-driven aromas follow through to the tannic palate together with licorice, roasted coffee bean and dried cherry.",Claudio Alario 2012 Sorano  (Barolo)
"Made from a grape that probably hails from the Somontano region of Spain (where it is known as Parraleta) this is a tight, stalky wine that has acidity and black currant fruit in abundance. Its tannins are more restrained than the fruit, allowing a light structure to hold up the juicy acidity and crisp aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",Clos Venturi 2015 1769 Carcajolu (Vin de France)
"Medium-gold to the eye, this wine has an interesting nose of grapefruit and coffee bean. It has flavors of pink grapefruit, almond paste, toast, vanilla and lemon curd and a slightly savory undercurrent on the palate that surges forward with notes of thyme and oregano on the finish.",Danieli 2014 Premium Kisi (Kakheti)
"Aromas recalling weedy underbrush, toast and cured meat take shape in the glass. The palate shows licorice, black-cherry extract and a green note of powdered sage alongside bracing tannins that squeeze the finish.",Diego Conterno 2012  Barolo

"This wine is fruity and ripe with fresh red-berry fruits and layers of smoky tannins. Those tannins will open up to give a rich, juicy and spicy wine from 2018.",Domaine Edmond Cornu 2014  Chorey-lès-Beaune
"This is fairly subtle for a Sauvignon, offering struck flint, fig and melon aromas. In the mouth, it's medium in weight, with hints of pink grapefruit and red currant. The finish is long and silky. Drink now.",Evans & Tate 2015 Fresh As A Daisy Sauvignon Blanc (Australia)
"This wine has a bright cherry character in the aromas and flavors along with medium body and a dry, firm texture. Lighter than many of its peers, but still cloaked in lots of fine tannins, it will improve with time. Wait until 2020.",Fenestra 2012 Ghielmetti Vineyard Petite Sirah (Livermore Valley)
"Coming on stiff and herbal, the Croft needs some time and patience. There are not quite resolved streaks of citrus, cherries, earthy tannins and a touch of cocoa powder. Still a baby, this should improve over the next three to five years.",Fullerton 2014 Croft Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"An elegant, restrained wine from the earthy appellation cooled by Pacific Ocean winds, this wine conveys a plethora of pretty clove, tea and rose petals, finished in cinnamon stick and vanilla.",Gehricke 2014 Pinot Noir (Los Carneros)
"Earthy aromas of truffle, game, ripe dark-skinned fruit and scorched soil lead the nose. The firmly structured palate shows dense cranberry, dried Morello cherry, game and a touch of clove alongside close-grained tannins. Let the tannins unwind then drink up.",Gian Piero Marrone 2011 Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Saucy, woody aromas of plum and berry are good but strained. This smacks down with high acidity and a sense of tomato. Salty flavors of tomato, herbs, red plum and currant remain salty on the finish.",TintoNegro 2013 Finca La Escuela La Arena Malbec (Mendoza)
"This nicely rich and rounded wine smells like vanilla and toasted bread. The flavors are ripe and black-cherry-like, with a hint of chocolate and baking spices that comes from oak. It's medium bodied and easy to like.",Tortoise Creek 2013 Cherokee Lane Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This wine is round and smooth, with attractive white-fruit flavors. The light acidity is more than compensated by the touch of toastiness and spice. With a juicy aftertaste, the wine is already very enjoyable.",Trenel Fils 2014  Mâcon-Villages
"This sports a blue label, to differentiate it from the winery's estate bottling. It's dark and toasty, with robust black-cherry fruit, along with strong notes of charcoal, espresso and vanilla. There's nothing subtle here, but should work well with Korean ribs.",Troon 2013 Blue Label Zinfandel (Applegate Valley)
"Smoky and rustic upfront, this mature Nebbiolo smells of cherry, cassis and wet cement. In the mouth, this is a bit heavy and syrupy, with grabby tannins and an overall sticky feel. Ripe, candied berry, cocoa and oaky flavors flatten out and turn chocolaty on the finish.",Viña Alicia 2008 Coleccion de Familia Nebbiolo (Luján de Cuyo)
"Nicely textured strawberry fruit is featured here. It drinks almost like an especially rich rosé, fresh and simple, in a good way. There's a dash of bitter green in the finishing tannins.",Willful 2014 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is an attractive wine, dominated by the typical Baga grape from Bairrada. Its tannins are tamed and rounded out producing rich black fruits and fine balanced acidity. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be even better from 2017.",Wines & Winemakers 2012 Azul Portugal Red (Bairrada)
"Wonderful blackberry and ripe grape flavors fill up this big but smooth new wine under country-music star Zac Brown's label. It has a very dark color, jammy aromas, rather sweet flavors and a velvety texture with enough tannin to keep it appetizing.",Z. Alexander Brown 2013 Uncaged Red (North Coast)

"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush. This has a hard, edgy, abrasive mouthfeel along with pinched, salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. Earthy berry flavors and drying tannins are in charge on the finish.",SignoSeis 2013 The Angel Oak Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"A joint offering from winemakers Mitch Cosentino and Paul Scotto, this is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, all grown in the Oak Knoll District. Softly textured, it's a nicely put-together commingling of black pepper, clove and blackberry.",50 Harvests 2013 Meritage (Napa Valley)
"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis. Long and solid on the finish; captures the essence of value-priced Malbec.",Trapiche 2010 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza)
"This wine consistently scores in the upper 80s. This vintage is dealing hard spice and herbal aromas along with tight-grained oak scents. Fresh but tannic, with bite and juicy, racy flavors of berry matched by woodspice. Fades away with hickory and BBQ flavors.",Ventisquero 2009 Grey [Glacier] Single Block Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Defines a certain California style in the intensely ripe, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, whose sweetness is accented by caramelized oak. Delicious, and the acidity and tannins are just fine, but it's a little obvious, and wants greater subtlety.",Black Kite 2009 Redwood's Edge Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.",Bodega Noemía de Patagonia 2010 A Lisa Malbec (Patagonia)
"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault.",Labouré-Roi 2009 Premier Cru Réserve  (Chablis)
"This exciting Brut Prosecco shows a very floral and fruity bouquet followed by a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The high quality of the aromas is what sets this wine apart from the competition.",Le Colture NV Fagher Brut  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Macari's supple, vanilla-scented Cab Franc is upfront and approachable in its sour cherry fruitfulness, yet boasts some complexity with layers of ripe, brambly wood, dust and dark floral notes. Finishes clean with lively acidity and a coating of grippy, yet fine-grained tannins.",Macari 2008 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)

Zin doesn't get much richer, but this one could be a little firmer in structure. Drink now.",Gary Farrell 2009 Bradford Mountain Vineyards Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry? Sort of, with a jammy finish of black raspberries. Try this easy-drinking wine with grilled tuna or a hamburger.",Virage 2010 Rosé (Napa Valley)

"The nose on this round, medium-bodied wine is defined by sweet oak and milk chocolate. In the mouth, it's chunky and ripe, with raw tannins.

"Mango, presumably, is the dog pictured on the label. This is a heavily-extracted, somewhat bitter Merlot, with fruit flavors of blackberry syrup, alcohol at 15%, and still a fair amount of green bitterness to the tannins. Notes of iodine and anise come into play in the finish.",Passion Vineyards 2009 Mango's Vineyard Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))

"A full-bodied yet crisp Chardonnay, balanced with just a tiny hint of lingering ripeness. Fine for mid-week meals.",Silver Buckle 2011 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"This blend of Montepulciano (85%) and Sangiovese is perky and clean with a nice touch of acidity beyond forest fruit, cherry and light shadings of exotic spice. It's solid, simple and easy-drinking.",Umani Ronchi 2011 Serrano  (Rosso Conero)
"This is concentrated and dark in color, with chocolaty berry and plum aromas. A full-bodied, plump and oaky palate houses milk chocolate and herbal blackberry flavors, while a healthy, driving finish with residual oak winds things down.",Vistamar 2011 Sepia Reserva Merlot (Central Valley)
"Released young, this fresh and citrusy wine is all about the fruit. Full in the mouth, it quickly settles into a cherry vanilla mid-palate, and sails on through a clean finish.",Willamette Valley Vineyards 2011 Whole Cluster Fermented Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Fermented in one ton French oak fermenters, this estate grown Pinot Noir from 1980s plantings has notes of cherry, char, and butterscotch. The fruit is on the lighter side of medium bodied with the wood just a bit too heavy for the wine that's in the glass.",Wy'East Vineyards 2010 Pinot Noir (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this is a lightly aromatic Gris with red apple and apple blossom. It's full bodied with a touch of residual sugar and a zip of acidity. A light ale note makes it seem not entirely finished.",Wy'East Vineyards 2012 Pinot Gris (Columbia Gorge (OR))
"The 2010 Sauce is three quarters Merlot, with Syrah and Malbec filling in the rest. It's a simple, accessible red blend, with accents of cut tobacco over black cherry fruit.",Zero One Vintners 2010 Sauce Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tasty in the modern style, with ripe, forward pineapple, orange, peach jam and buttered toast flavors. There's good acidity, and even a hint of minerals, but the wine ultimately is lushly one-dimensional.",Broadway Vineyards 2010 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Cool-climate aromas of passion fruit, nettle, tarragon and minerality are present in this Chilean SB. It is mostly fresh in the mouth, with body and standard Leyda flavors of citrus, nectarine, green herbs and sea salt. A round, herbal finish is showing a steady pulse that won't last forever. Drink now.",Caliterra 2011 Tributo Single Vineyard Block #Algarrobo Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley)
"This ambitious winery continues to struggle to find the formula for pricy Chardonnay. They turn now to this new Sonoma County appellation, but the result is still pretty ordinary. The wine is all about buttered toast, popcorn and fruit jam, with a creamy texture that's universally appealing.",Captûre 2011 Ma Vie Carol Chardonnay (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak)
"Solid and tannic with a stalky character both from young fruit and acidity. There is structure, black currant fruits and dense, dry tannins. The wine needs to age for at least 3–4 years.",Château Léoube 2011 Rouge de Léoube Red (Côtes de Provence)
"Bright and crisp with just a touch of vanilla along with the more citrus character. The wine has red berry fruits, a light structure, fragrant, ready to drink.",Domaine de la Sanglière 2012 Breezette Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Full and rounded, this is a soft wine, more suited to food than as an aperitif. The apple and red currant fruits are textured and spiced with lemon zest and mandarin orange flavors, finishing with some richness.",Domaine Sainte-Marie 2012 Vie Vité Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Ecco Domani delivers consistent, easy-drinking wines that work well on informal occasions, but don't necessarily offer personality or territorial typicity. But we don't always want intellectual wines. If you are hankering for bright citrus and peach with mouth-cleansing acidity, this is a great choice.",Ecco Domani 2011 Collezione Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie)
"This is super-rich, but wears its high alcohol lightly. That gives great full fruit, blackberry flavors, a juicy ripe wine that balances the wood and acidity to give fine potential for a year's time.",Grands Terroirs de France 2010 Grand Cru  (Saint-Émilion)
"Structured and elegant, it opens with a fruit fragrance of black plum, wild berries and prune accentuated with hints of leather, tilled soil and spice. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry layered with cinnamon, white pepper and carob alongside big, velvety tannins. Delicious now, it will also develop complexity. Drink now–2022.",Tenute Silvio Nardi 2007 Poggio Doria  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"In this restrained wine, red apple and green pear flavors framed by a mineral backdrop suggest both austerity and longevity. There is well-controlled power here and surprising depth with just a twist of white pepper and a pure finish.",Unger 2012 Gotschelle Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"The restrained aromatics of wet grass and gentle smoke are the only reminders that this is Sauvignon Blanc. This is lightyears removed from the pungently fragrant style that has made the variety so popular—here, it comes in a grown-up, classy guise with wonderfully judged balance and a lovely midpalate weight.",Neumeister 2012 Klausen Sauvignon Blanc (Südoststeiermark)
"Aromatic with crushed rock, raspberry, cranberry and hints of clove, this well-structured wine—53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot—will reward additional bottle age. The young, tart red fruits are steely and precise, the barrel influence perfectly balanced against the natural acidity.",Pepper Bridge 2011 Seven Hills Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.",Sequum 2009 Kidd Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The four soils designation refers to the wine's origins in different vineyards throughout the valley. A great followup to the marvelous 2009, the wine showcases artful blending. It's incredibly rich and ripe in black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak, yet balanced in acids and tannins. Drink now and through 2022.",Sequum 2010 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Very subtle hints of green and yellow pears play on the nose, intensifying on the palate and coming across round and plump, but not without some straightening, tonic freshness. There is a satisfying depth here, something mineral, and its elegance ensures that it's firm but not overbearing. A testament to what Pinot Blanc can be in the right hands.",Tinhof 2012 Golden Erd Weissburgunder (Burgenland)
"This dynamite Tempranillo hails from a top producer and a top vintage. Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish long, with mild heat and menthol notes that suggest aging is appropriate. Drink from 2015 through 2025.",Astrales 2010 Christina  (Ribera del Duero)
"While the wood is still very apparent in this wine, it does also have the rich fruit as a balance. The acidity, dark berry fruits and a fine juicy character go with the firm tannins and spicy wood character. Drink from 2017.",Château Lilian Ladouys 2011  Saint-Estèphe
"Even at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. The tough, astringent tannins make it essentially undrinkable now. Yet its underling wholesomeness and balance guarantee development through 2021, and possibly longer.",Duckhorn 2009 The Discussion Red (Napa Valley)
"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.",Fess Parker 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"plush wine, it's made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot. It starts off with aromas of black berries, plum and stewed prunes along with a whiff of cedar. The warm, low-acid palate delivers mature black cherry, black currants, tobacco and black pepper alongside big, ripe tannins and the warmth of the noticeable alcohol. Drink through 2020. Lyra Wine, The Shepherd Company.",Giovanni Chiappini 2010 Guado de' Gemoli  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"Hints of lemon peel rise shyly from the glass, becoming more intense with air. The palate is dry, buffered and has a savory undertow of wild thyme that interplays beautifully with sumptuous peach notes and that almost textured, zesty acidity that unites everything and brings extended, refreshing length.",Arndorfer 2012 Strasser Winberge Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"While the nose discloses little, the palate displays an array of apricot, sharp arugula and white pepper with some grapefruit zest. Focused and streamlined, this wine delivers lip-smacking freshness, great concentration and a super-clean finish. Drink as of 2016.",Jurtschitsch 2012 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"The wine is all about firm structure and dense tannins. It is concentrated while hiding rich, generous fruits. It still needs to balance the structure with the fruit. For the future, it will be a rich wine full of power.",Clos du Marquis 2011  Saint-Julien
"Held back for more than four years, this Cab remains tough in tannins and lush in primary fruits. It's as ripe as any '09 out there, with black cherry, currant, chocolate and roasted coconut flavors. A succulent sweetness runs throughout, despite the absolutely dry finish. Hold until 2018, and if you have more than one bottle, drink one every additional year.",Duckhorn 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Lime-zesty purity couples with an earthy, almost spicy edge. Pleasantly grippy phenolics speak of ripeness and plentitude while remaining streamlined, straight and long. This has yet to blossom but will be lovely. Drink as of 2017.",Eichinger 2012 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination. Powerful, sleek, dense and textural, the wine explodes from the glass, muscular and thick with black fruits and ripe tannins. Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",Gamache 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Grapefruit zest dominates this wine right now, but ripe honeydew melon also is shining though. As the wine opens up, it also reveals peppery, tangy spice and a refreshingly clean finish.",Gruber Röschitz 2012 Hundspoint Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"Dried fruit flavors and the bitter tang of dark fir honey are spiked by concentrated lemony acidity. The nose and palate are round and rich, but tamed by acidity that runs through like an electric current. This rich, dry but distinctly late-harvest style wine, with just a touch of residual sugar, finishes with triumphant apple fruit and lemon zest.",Hager Matthias 2012 Seeberg Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice. The vibrant palate delivers succulent wild cherry and white pepper restrained by fresh acidity and bracing tannins. It has mesmerizing depth, finesse and balance. Drink 2015–2028.",Salvioni 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern. Finishing notes of coffee, licorice, blackened toast and pepper bring a dark side to this long-lasting, deeply etched Malbec. Drink through 2018.",SignoSeis 2011 The Angel Oak Reserva Malbec (Valle de Uco)
"Creamy notes of red and yellow apples, just an edge of citrus zestiness and inviting notions of apricot announce a subtle, elegant white with a dense but never heavy structure. Rounded fruit with a wonderfully linear trajectory make this a worthwhile food companion. This is a wonderful expression of the indigenous Austrian Zierfandler.",Stadlmann 2012 Mandel-Höh Zierfandler (Thermenregion)
"The delicate smoke and hazelnut scent of oak shines through and makes a frame for ripe apricot and Mirabelle plums. The palate is soft and rounded, set off by pizzazz from the lively acidity that underlines the juicy core.",Ingrid Groiss 2012 Sauberg Tradition Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Sweaty, briny aromas are borderline offputting. This is plump on the palate, with flavors of pickled citrus fruits. The same can be said for the finish, which is also bitter, resiny and overoaked.",Casas del Bosque 2013 Gran Reserva Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Modest citrus, earth and almond notes come up from the glass, and continue in the flavors of this smooth, rounded, and straightforward wine. The balance is on the soft side, and the body is quite light.",Peltier 2013 Hybrid Sauvignon Blanc (Lodi)
A soft and indistinct wine that is fat and has only the merest hint of fruit. It is round with some fresh acidity at the end.,Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Vale das Donas White (Tejo)
"Rubbery, herbal aromas of stalky black fruits are typical of the variety but also gritty and horsey smelling. This has a snappy, grating mouthfeel and flavors of herbal blackberry and plum along with an acid-driven palate. Licorice, oak and vanilla flavors are present on the finish.",Santa Alicia 2014 Reserva Espiritu de Los Andes Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Aromas of green bean, shoe polish, carob and blackberry are heavy and oaky. A creamy weight dominates the palate, which also shows an unbalanced streak of tartaric acid. Herbal blackberry, plum and licorice flavors finish minty, with a resinous oak feel.",Santa Luz 2014 Reserva Encinos Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"This is a bright pink-colored wine, with caramel as much as fruit flavors. It has a light touch of acidity that gives the wine a lift at the end.",Quinta do Cavalinho 2014 Herdade dos Templários Rosé (Tejo)
"Rusty and light in color, with a dilute, stalky set of aromas, this thin Pinot is dry, a touch bitter and largely fruitless on the flavor profile. A bland, lightly woody finish tastes stalky and not fully ripe.",Tres Palacios 2014 Reserve Pinot Noir (Maipo Valley)
"Latex, earth and briar patch aromas are rough on the nose. Cranberry, red plum, olive and herbal flavors finish a bit sour, with a snappy feel.",Creación 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)
"Aromas of almond skins, pyrazines and spent white fruits struggle to draw you in. This vintage was wet and cool in Galicia, with frost issues, and this shows it. The palate is round but oily in feel, while flavors of saline water, pithy citrus and bitter melon finish peppery and soft, with low acidity.",Don Bernardino 2013 Godello (Valdeorras)
"Here's a frail red that offers weak sensations of sour cherry and strawberry alongside zesty acidity and fleeting, gritty tannins. It's short and dilute.",Grati 2014 Red (Toscana)
"Leafy, earthy cherry and plum aromas lead to a clampy, astringent palate with saucy, tart, rubbery plum flavors. Savory spice notes come up on a tannic, drying, unyielding finish.",Pata Negra 2012 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)
"This Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus. A linear body is propped up by lemony acidity, while flavors of lemon peel, tangerine and lees finish citric. Overall, this smells and tastes nothing like the Riesling most people know.",Cristiari 2013 Riesling (Costers del Segre)
"Earthy, vegetal aromas and equally earthy, peppery flavors make this wine unusually rustic. It does have traces of good aged character, like leather and tea.",Ripken 2011 Under the Sea Primitivo (Lodi)
"Sturdy and basic, this Pinot Noir has vegetal aromas, modest fruit flavors, and a dry, lean texture. Aromas suggest tomato and herbs, while flavors are more rich.",Camelot NV Pinot Noir (California)
"Cheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around.",Dominio del Viento 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)
"This rosé is made from Cabernet Franc grapes, and it's briny to an extreme, with vegetal aromas. The palate is scattered in feel and lacks grace, while pickled citrus dominates the flavor profile. A mustardy, briny finish with jalapeño notes is no savior.",Lomas del Valle 2014 Coastal Cool Climate Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc Rosé (Casablanca Valley)
"Seltzer and sauerkraut are off putting on the nose. It's scattered and salty tasting, with citrus and celery notes.",François Lurton 2013 Hermanos Lurton Verdejo (Rueda)
"Mild citrus and grassy aromas are quiet, while this feels pithy and flat for a young wine. Tangerine and persimmon flavors are not on the money for Sauvignon Blanc, with a mildly bitter and pyrazinic finish.",Alto Los Romeros 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Blue-fruit aromas and flavors are indistinct on the nose. Massive tannins, lemony oak, plastic and graphite notes drive the palate. The finish is a forced marriage of licorice, oak, and vanilla.",Montes 2013 Classic Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Aromas of rubber and floor wax lack fruit and nuance. This has a high-acid, granular mouthfeel that lacks full cohesion. Waxy, salty flavors crowd out primary fruit flavors, while this finishes briny, high in acid and salty.",Zerran 2013 Garnatxa Blanca Garnacha Blanca (Montsant)
"Aromas of peach pit, dried almond skins and white pineapple are on the raw side, while the palate on this Viognier-heavy blend is waxy yet citric. Flavors of white grapefruit and lemon are pithy, and finish with bitter almond flavors.",Estampa 2013 Estate Viognier-Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"This is an unusual mix of disparate flavors—some spice, some mint, eucalyptus, lemon, pineapple—all with a rather bitter edge. It falls apart on the finish, with a chemical, paint thinner aftertaste.",Gresser NV Brut Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
"This medium-bodied wine has very subtle aromas and flavors, a fairly smooth texture, and an ever-so-slightly buttery accent. It offers a slim personality to enjoy.",Insomnia 2013 Pinot Grigio (California)
"The aromas are driven by freshly cut wood tones, while the palate is full, creamy and oaky. Raw wood and resin flavors are like licking a plank, and the only flavors in this wine besides oak are lanolin and cinnamon.",Santa Alba 2012 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Maule Valley)
"This is a very watery, almost scentless wine, with hints of golden apples on the nose. The palate is also lacking, showing slight pears and nectarines. The DIY label is a cute gimmick though.",Scratchpad 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Coast)
"Cherry and red-plum aromas are also horsey, jammy and suggestive of bacon fat. An astringent palate ranks as severely rugged and drawing. Bitter red-plum flavors simmer prior to a hard-tannin finish that's peppery and tart.",Terrai 2013 OVG Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Wheaty and waxy on the nose, this Viura also smells of vinyl and corn. A limited palate is directed by pointed acidity, while flavors of almond skins and pithy citrus are somewhat bitter and finish with zero character.",Bodegas Riojanas 2013 Puerta Vieja Blanco Viura (Rioja)
"Barnyard aromas with coffee grinds and lemony blackberry are less than inviting. This feels raw, scratchy and abrasive; flavors of herbal cherry and plum turn green and weedy on the finish.",Santa Ema 2014 Select Terroir Carmenère (Cachapoal Valley)
"Chunky aromas of hay and mealy stone fruits are acceptable. This Sauvignon Blanc has a melony, creamy palate and mealy flavors of melon and papaya that match the bouquet. A yeasty, undefined finish indicates this is past its prime.",Trencalòs 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Dark and ominous in color, with a grapy, rustic, smoky nose, this Garnacha is high in acid, rubbery and tannic on the palate. Semisour black-plum flavors finish equally tannic and acidic.",Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2013 Menguante Garnacha (Cariñena)
"Loosen's best Dr. L to date, this is a terrific value, delivering typical Mosel Riesling notes at a great price. Citrus blossom, lime and crushed stone aromas are followed by apple and citrus flavors in this just-slightly-sweet wine. Drink it now and over the next year or so.",Loosen Bros. 2010 Dr. L Riesling (Mosel)
"Mer Soleil's Chardonnay grapes dependably get so ripe, they offer explosive flavors even without oak. You won't miss a thing without that barrel. The pineapple, orange and golden mango flavors are delicious on their own, and even offer a hint of vanilla. A mouthwateringly fresh squeeze of acidity makes everything bright and clean.",Mer Soleil 2010 Silver Unoaked Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Like the label says, this Viognier is sweet, with honey, apricot, orange and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with fine acidity. Give it more concentration, and the score would soar. Still, it's a very nice dessert wine for the price.",Novy 2010 Oley Late Harvest Sweet Viognier (Russian River Valley)
"Virtually identical with Pinot Noir, and quite a good one at that. Shows cool-climate influence in the translucent color, vital acidity and pure flavors of raspberries and persimmons, accented with smoky oak.",Novy 2010 Van der Kamp Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Sonoma Mountain)
"A super-interesting blend of 37% Syrah, 21% Mourvèdre, 18% Carignan, 10% Petite Sirah, 10% Grenache and 8% Tannat, the bouquet is loaded with assertive aromas of black currant, licorice, black olive, whole tobacco leaf, cigar box spice and leather. Creamy but firmly textured, like crushed velvet, with a rich boysenberry and plum juiciness to the palate.",Spice Route 2009 Chakalaka Red (Swartland)

The screwcap bottle locks in fresh floral aromas, natural rubber and citrus.",Tiefenbrunner 2009 Kirchleiten Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Big-hearted wine, full of warm and rich fruit. It has a solid core of dusty tannins, black plum fruit flavors and a delicious, chewy, juicy texture. It does have power as well as intense fruitiness. Age for 3–4 years.",Château Eugénie 2008 Cuvée Pierre le Grand Malbec-Merlot (Cahors)

"Pure and striking from the start, with menthol aromas that come with blackberry and cassis. Feels dense and concentrated, with blackberry, prune and dark spice flavors. Layered, mellow and slight jammy on the multitiered finish. Drink now.",Gouguenheim Winery 2006 Blue Melosa Malbec (Mendoza)
"Big, spicy wine with its dark tannins and black fruit. Dark chocolate flavors go with the fruit, a rich and complex array of flavors that bring in herbs and spices as well as wood. Age for another 1–2 years.",Henri Milan 2006 Les Clos Red (Les Baux de Provence)
"Yes, this does not shy away from the herbal bite often found in Oregon Pinot. But that accent is nicely integrated into a firm, balanced wine with penetrating red fruits and darker notes of black coffee, black licorice and a whiff of fresh truffle.",Illahe 2008 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A Bordeaux-style blend made from 50% Cab Sauv, 30% Merlot and 20% Cab Franc and aged in new French oak for 24 months, this ripe and lush wine is ready for drinking now with easygoing black cherry and blackberry fruit aromas and flavors laced with notes of pepper, licorice root, tobacco leaf and soft leather. The creamy mouthfeel is given structure with medium tannins and balanced acidity.",Jardin 2006 Cobblers Hill Red (Stellenbosch)

"The most impressive of the range of wines from Laurenz Moser V. It is tight with minerality, pepper and apple skin flavors. With a steely texture and intense youthful acidity, it's a wine that needs to age for at least 2 years. Screwcap.",Laurenz V. 2010 Charming Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"If you love Italian whites, Confini is definitely worth your attention. It represents a blend of Pinot Grigio, Traminer and Riesling. The obvious outcome is that the first variety supplies the density and creaminess, and the last two drive the fragrant floral bouquet.",Lis Neris 2008 Confini White (Venezia Giulia)
Soft layers of Chardonnay with aromas of vanilla cream and stone fruit are blended with fresh notes of citrus and passion fruit from the Vermentino element found within. The two varieties complement each other very well and produce an elegant wine for shellfish or seafood risotto.,Lungarotti 2008 Torveto White (Umbria)
"Blackberry and rubber aromas are friendly and forward, with spice added in for good measure. Feels full, lush and cushioned, with integrated tannins, good acidity and bright red berry flavors dusted by herbs and spice. Finishes smooth and true. A winning wine from a difficult vintage.",Martino 2008 Reserva Old Vine Malbec (Agrelo)
"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",McCay Cellars 2008 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
Penon Pinot Bianco is a fragrant and intense white wine with aromas of stone fruit and white rose splashed over a dense and creamy mouthfeel. This beautiful white wine would match northern Italian dishes such as paper-thin lasagna with a poppy seed cream filler.,Nals Margreid 2009 Penon Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"Novy's Syrahs have really hit their stride lately. This one, from this little Sonoma County appellation, is soft and rich in blackberries, blueberries and Canadian bacon, with a smoky layer of charred oak. It is, in a word, delicious.",Novy 2008 Judge Family Vineyard Syrah (Bennett Valley)
"Textbook entry-level Riesling, tightly coiled and medium-bodied, with lovely tension between sweet green-apple fruit notes, minerally hints of crushed stone and zesty acids that recall pink grapefruit. Drink now.",Peter Nicolay 2010 Riesling (Mosel)

"An interesting, well-made blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat that deals lemony oak, spice, coconut and ripe berry aromas.

"Soft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice. Terrific with mushroom risotto.",Longboard 2007 Wholer Vineyard Pinotage (Russian River Valley)
"Still very young with its tannins dominant, this will nevertheless be a richly fruity wine as it develops. The black fruits are all there, along with licorice and bitter chocolate. Final acidity brings a lift to the dense texture.",Jean-Luc Baldès 2009 Château de Flore Malbec (Cahors)
"The name of this wine doesn't lie; if you like mint, then this one's definitely for you! Gorgeous notes of fresh eucalyptus take center stage to the blackberry and boysenberry fruit backbone. The menthol continues on in the mouth, with a gripping and structured finish that tastes like Thin Mint crumbles.",Morgenhof 2009 Mint Haven Cabernet Sauvignon (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)

"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.",Michel Torino 2007 Cuma Organic Torrontés (Cafayate)
"Italy's first cru Verdicchio, Le Moie offers loads of citrus-and lime-like nuances on the heels of stone fruit, field flowers and fruit candy. Sweet fruit notes create a lively, tangy impression. A tiny percentage is aged in wood.",Fazi Battaglia 2005 Le Moie  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Soft and lush, the flavors are just delicious, ranging from cherries and cassis to cola, cocoa, gingersnap cookie, rose petal tea and Asian spices. With every sip, you find something new. The wine would benefit from a firmer texture, though, as it's on the soft, one-dimensional side.",Miner 2005 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"One of the most attractive aspects of this fresh white blend is its structure: The wine is silky and smooth and seemingly weightless at the same time. That kind of structure is a good platform for flavors of pear, exotic fruit, honey and almond. Try it with grilled shrimp in a cilantro pesto sauce.",Monte del Frá 2005 Cà del Magro  (Custoza Superiore)
"Intense flavors of mango, melon and apricot lead on this lively but rich dessert. The palate is bursting with flavor but layered spice softens and adds depth.

"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.",Luigi Bosca 2004 Gala 2 Red (Mendoza)
"Pineapple, banana, peach and apricot are followed by a dusty mineral quality that adds extra dimension. This is a tasty, fruit-forward wine that closes with tingling, spicy crispness.",Masottina 2005 Ai Palazzi Pinot Grigio (Piave)
"This refreshing wine is clean and dry, with grapefruit, peach and honeysuckle flavors boosted by high, tingly acidity. Made Sancerre-style, it leaves behind a spicy, fruity aftertaste.",Andretti 2006 Selections Fumé Blanc (North Coast)
"A little big and heavy, but that's the style that Kaiken has pushed since arriving on the market a few years ago. This version has baked-fruit aromas backed by lemon peel and espresso, while the palate is rich, dark and syrupy, but also oaky and tannic. Seems to want to offer more than it can deliver. The 14.5% alcohol level tells you that it's a big boy.",Kaiken 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark. The tannins have a green edge to them, and perhaps as a result, the vanilla flavors  seem to stick out rather awkwardly.",Kestrel 2004 Merlot (Yakima Valley)
"This winery seems to be trying to find an identity. The Cabs are vintage-driven, and do better in cool years, which 2004 wasn't. This wine is a little soft and direct, but delicious enough, with ripe, pastry-filling blackberry, cherry, boysenberry and chocolate flavors. You can taste high-char oak on the finish.",Martin Ranch 2004 Thérèse Vineyards Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Here's a no fuss wine for everyday dinners with loads of fresh fruit, kiwi, pineapple and a strong emphasis on floral fragrances. The flavors focus on dried fruit, sun-dried apple chips in particular.",Aldegheri 2006 le Pietre White (Veronese)
"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",Andrew Will 2005 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Sangiovese (Red Mountain)
"Definitely more neutral than other Pinot Biancos from the same vintage, this wine delivers measured aromas of apple, pear, peach and natural rubber that is consistent with the variety's traditional characteristics. It's an approachable, everyday wine.",Cantina Terlano 2006 Pinot Bianco (Alto Adige)
"You'll love the delicate floral fragrances of this feminine, cool-climate northern Italian white. Acacia, jasmine and honeysuckle play a leading role with a supporting cast of stone fruit and pear. In the mouth, it's not particularly intense or thick.",Girlan 2006 Toretta Classico White (Alto Adige)
"Hints of honey and orange marmalade on the nose suggest a wine moving toward maturity at a rapid pace, and one gets a similar impression from the palate, which shows similar development. It's stony and layered with honeyed citrus without being sweet, with a wiry feel to the lingering finish. Drink now.",Carl Ehrhard 2008 Rudesheimer Kabinett Dry Riesling (Rheingau)
"From this longstanding grape grower and Napa-based producer is a Mendocino-sourced Gewürztraminer that's beautifully gold in color and full of pretty tropical aromas. Balanced, with good acidity, this is a Gewürztraminer that's light on its feet and still retains the right amount of spice.",Madrigal 2010 Gewürztraminer (Mendocino)
"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish.",Matetic 2010 EQ Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
"Smoky, dark and rich, this oak-aged Ripasso is packed tight with savory aromas of barbecue smoke, bresaola, licorice and sun-dried fruit. There's a sweet note on the close followed by smooth, soft tannins.",Montezovo 2009  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso
"Toasty, minty and sweet smelling. The palate is dark, full and choppy feeling, with cola, coconut, mint, blackberry and cassis flavors. There's good power and depth to this Malbec; a bit rough and herbal at the finish line.",Odfjell 2009 Orzada Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"Aromas of cedar and damp soil lend a clean, foresty air to this beautifully ripe yet restrained Bordeaux blend. Black fruit flavors are intensely concentrated yet brisk with acidity, strident grape tannins and a lingering granite finish.",Pellegrini Vineyards 2005 Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"Among the single-vineyard 2008 Pinots from Rex Hill, this is the lightest in flavor and style. Ripe strawberry fruit, medium-bodied, is buttressed with generous natural acidity. Highlights of fresh-cut herbs dot the finish.",Rex Hill 2008 Alloro Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"Exotic pineapple, lime and tangerine scents combine with notes of slate and wet stone on this lovely Riesling. It's quite dry, but feels lush on the palate with a sweet grapefruit softness. Finishes long and minerally.",Rooster Hill 2009 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Minerality and passion fruit aromas control the bouquet. The palate is fresh and zesty, with grapefruit, lime and green apple flavors. Holds its form and tightness on the finish, staying juicy and fresh from front to back.",Root:1 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"For $9 a nice wine in a nice package, made from old-vine Zinfandel from Lodi. The red fruit on the nose pops out pleasantly followed by smooth tannins and a fruity, chocolaty mix of flavors.","Salvatore Principe 2009 Take Flight, Artists Collection Limited Edition Zinfandel (Lodi)"
This well crafted wine opens with textured renderings of barbecue spice and toasted oak followed by velvety fruit and blackberry. The wine is layered and deep with a playful touch of sour fruit on the close.,Sartori 2006 I Saltari Le Vigne di Turano  (Valpolicella Superiore)
"Swirls of smoke and freshly pressed apples entice on the nose of this lean, dry Riesling. On the palate, hints of chalk and wet stone meld with a shower of fresh white grapefruit flavors, finishing long with a bold smoke and honey note.",Sheldrake Point 2007 Reserve Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Beatifully pétillant with small, persistent beads, this hints of tangerine and lemons skins against a backdrop of fresh mushrooms and madacamia nuts. The foam is quite mouthfilling, but lemony acidity leads to a lingering finish.",Sparkling Pointe 2005 Blanc de Blancs Sparkling (North Fork of Long Island)
"One of the richer, riper Edna Valley Pinots, offering waves of raspberry and cherry marmalade flavors. It sure is delicious, if a little direct. Drink now with lusty fare, like cold smoked salmon or chorizo.",Stephen Ross 2009 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"Amarone La Coeta opens with huge oak tones of spice and campfire that will definitely need a few more years of cellar aging before they soften. But this wood-heavy formula does work, given the hearty, thick nature of the wine itself.",Corte Lenguin 2007 La Coeta  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This Ripasso-method Valpolicella is aged for two years in cherry wood to add complexity and intensity to its aromatic bouquet. You'll recognize tones of cola, dark spice, mature fruit, cassis and bitter almond.",Corte Sant' Alda 2008 Campi Magri  (Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso)
"With a touch of oak, this friendly Chardonnay is a very nice wine for everyday drinking. It's dry and brisk, with pleasant apricot, tangerine and mineral flavors.",Educated Guess 2009 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Pleasantly yeasty on the nose with hints of sweet biscuit and brioche, Wiemer's Cuvée Brut is dry and fresh with a bright, lemony midpalate. Persistently effervescent with clean, nervy acidity.",Hermann J. Wiemer 2006 Cuvée Brut Sparkling (Finger Lakes)
"There's a gorgeous sheen of minerality that glimmers from start to finish on this vervy but honey-kissed off-dry Riesling. Smoky and rich on the palate with hints of slate and crushed rock, the finish is long with a tasty lime skin finish.",Hermann J. Wiemer 2009 Semi-Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Dry and bright in acidity, with a clean, silky mouthfeel. Shows fine raspberry and cherry fruit, with a squeeze of tangerine, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now with pork tenderloin, ahi tuna, roasted salmon.",Holman Ranch 2009 Pinot Noir (Carmel Valley)
"Green and spunky on the nose, with light citrus aromas and nothing forced, sour or funky. The palate is full and a little creamy, with just enough acidic kick. Tastes of green melon, lime and banana. Lasting acidity provides pulse to the finish.",Viña Casablanca 2010 Nimbus Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"From one of Germany's few biodynamic producers, this combines struck flint and honeyed ripeness on the nose, then offers apple, citrus and fennel-like flavors. Despite the medium body, the acids are bracing and almost sharp on the finish.",Wittmann 2009 Westhofener Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"A long oak regime (36 months in barrel) helps cement this Amarone's tones of barbecue sauce, cola, savory spice and dark fruit. The wine shows a ripe, chewy quality with loads of masculine power and intensity.",Zanoni 2006 Zovo  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"This Ripasso presents an interesting nose with clove, fresh curry leaf, cherry liqueur and bitter chocolate. It's smooth and balanced with a simple but genuine delivery overall.",Arduini 2009  Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso
"Well priced for the quality, Chapel Hill's Shiraz-Grenache is barely a blend, with only 10% Grenache. It comes across as a nicely complex, easy-drinking Shiraz, marrying mulberry fruit with hints of chocolate, cracked pepper and fresh herbs. The texture is plush and the finish long; a super value at under $20 to drink now and over the next few years.",Chapel Hill 2006 Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"New wood overwhelms the aromas, and it also dominates the palate of this wine. It just keeps on the right side of drinkability because the spice merges into pear flavors to give an intriguing nutmeg character, while the aftertaste offers freshness. The wine needs at least a year to blend together.",Château de Fuissé 2006 Les Brulés  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Smooth and sweet, like a cream Sherry is supposed to be. On the nose, this one easily shifts from ripe apricot and peach fruit to nuts and saline. The palate starts with a blast of coffee and mocha and then folds in brown sugar and spice. Sweet, long and generous, with accents of cinnamon, clove and mild chocolate. Uncomplicated, which for $13 is a virtue.",Hidalgo NV Morenita Cream Sherry (Jerez)
"With its briary flavors of fresh-picked mountain berries and exotic clove, nutmeg and pepper spices, this Zin defines a more elegant Foothills approach to the variety. The texture is light and silky, not at all heavy, a supple, polished wine of great appeal.",Karly 2006 Buck's Ten Point Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Even in cooler 2007, Zull scores with this wine. It has all the right pear and apple perfumes, along with vibrant acidity and minerality. It's going to develop well over the next 4 years into a fine, elegant wine. Screwcap.",Zull 2007 Innere Bergen Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis Sémillon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.",Henschke 2005 Louis Semillon (Eden Valley)
"With its tight minerality and vivid green fruits, this is a fine representative of the freshness and richness of 2006. While Bouchard Père is generous with the wood, it does not dominate because the fruit flavor texture and finishing freshness are so important.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2006  Chassagne-Montrachet
"Full and rich with thick concentration, this modern Aglianico offers generous tones of blackberry, blueberry, exotic spice, chocolate, mineral, vanilla, toast, clove and cardamom. It has a luscious and clean feel in the mouth backed by sweet cherry flavors and good length.",Cantina Giardino 2004 Nude Aglianico (Irpinia)
"Though Grüner doesn't have a reputation in Austria for ice wine as do other varieties, based on the strength of this wine, maybe it should. It has a great balance between toffee sweetness and high acidity, the intensity softened and broadened by spice and toffee.",Schloss Gobelsburg 2006 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A classy Sherry with full, attractive hazelnut and peanut oil aromas. The palate holds to that nuttiness while introducing maple and toffee flavors. Thick in the mouth but not the least bit sticky, so it has that proper oloroso feel in front of a nutty, long finish.",Hidalgo NV Gobernador Oloroso Seco Palomino (Jerez)
"This supple and smooth Fiano delivers notes of pear, Golden Delicious apple and yellow melon. The wine is layered and complex thanks to the mineral nuances that accompany it to the end. It is also chewy, naturally robust and promises an excellent match to lobster, crab or baked clams.",Mastroberardino 2007 Radici  (Fiano di Avellino)
"The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",Nickel & Nickel 2005 Suscol Vineyard Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This is the best Obsidian Cab since the 2002, and for similar reasons. It was a good vintage for Cabernet. The wine is rich and peppery and lush in black currant flavors, with beautifully sculpted, ripe tannins. Provides more evidence that this Red Hills of Lake County appellation has enormous potential for Cabernet.",Obsidian Ridge 2005 Obsidian Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)
"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture. Crisp acidity makes the wine brilliantly clean. With the exception of the '04, an off-vintage, this bottling has been wonderfully consistent.",Gary Farrell 2007 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Beautifully concentrated and redolent of spice and evident oak aging, this is a powerful wine from the Amalfi Cost that offers tobacco, leather, ash, slate roof, cola, vanilla, blackberry and plump cherry. The grapes used in the blend are the little-known Tintore and Piedirosso varieties native to Campania. Who knew they could taste this good?",Giuseppe Apicella 2003 A' Scippata Riserva Costa d'Amalfi Red (Campania)
"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but it's fun and delicious and utterly unique, in its own high mountain way. Completely dry, the flavors are of blackberries cooked into a pie and black pepper, with just a hint of raisins.",Karly 2005 Sadie Upton Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Magno Megonio offers beautiful mineral notes behind a curtain of pulsing berry fruit and cola. This wine, made from the promising Magliocco grape, really does have character and exhibits fine winemaking in Calabria, a harsh and often overlooked region of southern Italy. Those drying minerals give the wine balance and persistency on the finish.",Librandi 2005 Magno Megonio Magliocco (Val di Neto)
"Typical of a fine young S&B; Pinot, this is rather hard and closed in tannins now, although decanting will help coax out the cherry and currant fruit. But it really needs a good 4–6 years.",Longoria 2006 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A wide-open, friendly wine, all delicious rich white fruits and tropical flavors. While it may not be ageworthy, it is a pleasure now, an opulent mouthful of Chardonnay.",Louis Latour 2006 Les Folatières Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"The estate reserve is simply a barrel selection that the winery feels represents the top 10% of their estate-grown Pinot Noir. Basically it offers quite similar flavors; for the extra money you get more butterfat, more cherry fruit and a little less herb. What it gains in power, the wine loses in detail and nuance; depending upon your own palate preferences, the regular estate might be the better value.",Apolloni 2006 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Here's a bone-dry, powerful young Syrah that's packed with hard tannins. The vineyard sourcing is interesting, ranging from the Sierra Foothills through Paso Robles and the Salinas Valley to the Santa Cruz Mountains. Combining the ripe fruit of warm climates with the acidity of cool regions, the wine has black currant, beef jerky, sour cherry candy, black pepper, anise and cola flavors that are quite complex. Not likely to age, but a lovely, full-bodied red to have now.",Bonny Doon 2005 Le Pousseur Syrah (Central Coast)
"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak.",Chelsea Goldschmidt 2006 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley)
"Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style. Black tea, ground spices, coffee and raw oak work the finish. A dark and handsome wine, but one that isn't overly complex and is ready to drink now through 2011.",CVNE 2001 Real De Asúa  (Rioja)
"Campania's celebrated Feudi di San Gregorio recently unveiled a new, revamped style for its white wines. This debut vintage delivers gorgeous tones of peachy cream and sophisticated mineral tones. It's an oak-fermented expression of Greco di Tufo from 15-year-old vines.",Feudi di San Gregorio 2006 Cutizzi  (Greco di Tufo)
"Here's an elegant Pinot Noir that restaurateurs should buy for its food companionability. The mouthfeel has a lighter style than some Pinots. But it's packed with flavor, and is bone dry and crisp, making it ideal for steaks and chops or even Asian fusion. The flavors suggest cherries, black raspberries, root beer, tangerine zest, cloves, pepper and cinnamon.",Foppiano 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Blackberry syrup, slate roof, natural rubber, exotic spice, resin and root beer describe this thickly extracted Taurasi Riserva. The wine offers power, concentration and blockbuster tannins. It would pair well with marinated beef and barbecue sauces. Drink after 2010.",GMG Vinicola 2001 Riserva  (Taurasi)
"V.T.S. stands for Vintage Top Select, the prestige cuvee from Hans Moser. It's an eclectic blend of every grape imaginable, from Cabernet Sauvignon to Syrah, by way of Zweigelt and Blaufränkisch. What you get is a superrich wine that's beginning to mature, with dark plum jelly and sweet black fruit flavors. It is ripe and concentrated, just finishing with some firmness.",Hans Moser 2004 V.T.S. Red (Burgenland)
"Fresh, ripe, inviting and 180° opposite of this producer's white cavas, which seem bubbly and fizzy compared to this balanced, subtle, even smoky offering. In the mouth, it's tasty and dry, with cherry nuances going stride for stride with pink grapefruit and raspberry. A refined rosé Cava that's sure to light your fire.",Oriol Rossell NV Brut Rosé Sparkling (Cava)
"Retour relies on fruit sourced from so-called “old vine” Pinot vineyards. It's full, fleshy, round and brightly fruity, with plenty of spicy chocolate from extended barrel aging. Some whole cluster fermentation and native yeasts contribute to the complexity. A very fine debut.",Retour 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Meursault can manage big and bold, and this wine definitely lives up to that reputation. The spice and wood are perhaps too much at this stage. I would certainly like to see more of the ripe white fruits that are there in the background. A wine to return to in a year.",Roux Père et Fils 2006 Clos des Poruzots Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"The nose does not want to give a lot away. The palate, however, shows spicy hints of nettle and a fresh bouncy zesty backbone of lemon and grapefruit, which makes it all the more appetizing.",Steininger 2015 Kittmannsberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Spicy and supple, this has aromas of cured meat, white pepper, toast and dark plum that follow the warm robust palate along with dried black cherry, coffee and licorice. Round tannins provide the supple framework. Drink through 2020.",Tua Rita 2013 Per Sempre Syrah (Toscana)
"Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, violet and a whiff of baking spice. On the bright silky palate, notes of pipe tobacco, chopped herb and a hint of game add depth to the red-berry core.",Tua Rita 2013 Perlato del Bosco Sangiovese (Toscana)
"The inviting notion of gently sun-ripened yellow plums on the nose draws you in. The palate follows this with gentle, juicy but balanced ripeness, featuring mirabelle plum and pear. There is a welcome grapefruit zestiness to the body and finish that makes this refreshing and moreish.",Türk 2015 Kremser Sandgrube Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"The lemony nose promises freshness. Tangy citrus fruits are abundant on the flowing palate, which wraps you up in its easy freshness. This is balanced, fruity and very refreshing.",Türk 2015 Kremser Wachtberg Reserve Riesling (Kremstal)
"This wine has that wonderful but hard-to-pin-down Zinfandel essence that's extremely fruity but also uniquely spicy and brambly. It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger.",Wood Family Vineyards 2014 Big Wood Zin Zinfandel (Livermore Valley)
"High-toned aromas of cocoa, barrel spice, vanilla and dark fruit lead to plentiful, focused fruit and barrel flavors. The flavors linger on the finish.",Airfield Estates 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Comprised of 75% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot, this is a juicy, savory and lengthy wine, with herbaceous elements of cedar, brush and peppercorn. A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish.",Ancient Oak Cellars 2012 Reserve Series Alcaeus Berger Vineyard Red (Sonoma Mountain)
"There is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose. The palate shows more layers, starting with ripe peach and then firming up on citrus pith, sour apple and tangy pear. A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.",Broken Earth 2015 Verdelho (Paso Robles)
"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.",Township 7 2015 Blue Terrace Vineyard Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Okanagan Valley)
"Light in color and body, this is a cool-climate-influenced wine full of spice and life. It offers a mixture of rhubarb, strawberry and black tea, dusted in cardamom. The wine's spicy tones carry through to the medium-length finish.",Balletto 2014 Sexton Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Richly structured this wine, from well-exposed vines (hence the land of light in the name) is fruity with black cherry and some firm tannins. It is going to develop into a serious, complex wine. Drink from 2018.",Château de Chatelard 2015 Cuvée Terre de Lumière  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Finding new varietals is always fun, and this take on an ancient grape from Campania, Italy, offers promise in warm Temecula. Crisp Anjou and Asian pears show on the nose, along with salt, Gala apple, white flowers and gravel. Sharp citrus appears on the palate, with lime pith, pink-grapefruit juice and a chalky, seashell component.",Cougar 2015 Falanghina (Temecula Valley)
"Made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this bold wine opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and exotic spice. The concentrated palate delivers blueberry jam, graphite, anise and clove alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish.",Donna Olimpia 1898 2013 Millepassi  (Bolgheri)
"Aromas of vanilla, baking spice, wood spice and pitch-black fruit are followed by power-packed fruit and barrel flavors. The oak is primary at present. Give it time to integrate. Best after 2021.",Dusted Valley 2013 Petite Sirah (Wahluke Slope)
"From entirely estate-grown fruit and blended with 5% Cabernet Franc, this is a soft, full and well-structured wine, sanguine in currant, cassis and a dusting of brambly raspberry. Inviting, it finishes in a pleasing note of mocha.",Ehlers Estate 2013 Merlot (St. Helena)
"The winery's annual stainless-steel bottling, this is showy rather than reserved, with ripe Asian pear, tropical flowers, sweet apple blossoms, pineapple and a bit of vanilla on the nose. Nicely fresh, it's bright on the palate, with a sizzle of acidity and grippy chalkiness that frame the poached-pear palate.",Foley 2014 Steel Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"From an small estate that also has vines in Chénas and Saint-Amour, this is a firmly tannic wine that also has attractive juicy red-berry fruits. The wine, still young, will repay aging allowing it to broaden out with rich fruit and a soft texture. Drink this cru from late 2017.",Georges Duboeuf 2015 Domaine de Roche Noire  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"An initial hit of reduction blows off to reveal rich vanilla backed by gentle lemon purity. This clearly needs some time in bottle to find its middle but all the basics are there: freshness, clean fruit, texture and poise. Drink 2028–2025.",Gernot and Heike Heinrich 2014 Chardonnay (Leithaberg)
"A surprising 30% of this wine is Clairette, a white grape variety. Perhaps that accounts for the wine's apparent freshness. Hints of crushed stone mark the nose, while the ripe flavors suggest peaches and berries, tailing away slowly on the finish. Drink this mouthfilling rosé over the rest of 2017.",Chateau de Manissy 2015 Cuvée de Lys  (Tavel)
"Fresh aromas, vivid citrus flavors, elegance and poise make this an attractive wine. It has a balance that is easy to enjoy and keeps calling for more sips, with pleasant notes of citrus and green fruit throughout.",Murphy-Goode 2015 The Fumé Sauvignon Blanc (North Coast)
"Deep color and lots of concentration make this full-bodied wine stand out. It has smoky, black-peppery aromas along with ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors. Firm tannins add texture. This boldness needs rich food for a pairing.",Naggiar 2014 Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills)
"Aromas of black currant and a whiff of bell pepper slowly emerge on this hearty blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. Concentrated and robust, the palate offers cassis, black cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside big velvety tannins.",Poggio al Tesoro 2013 Sondraia  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"Wonderfully heady hints of yuzu play about the nose. The palate, on the other hand, is characterized by ripe juicy mirabelle plums. This is plump and opulent, yet structured: a rounded and generous souvenir of the 2015 vintage.",Rainer Wess 2015 Pfaffenberg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Toast with apricot jam comes first to mind in this nicely balanced white that begins in richness and evolves in the glass to offer a freshness of lime zest and grapefruit, the minerality well-defined.",Robert Mondavi 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)
"This is a very light expression of the grape from a San Francisco-based producer, with thyme, chaparral, cranberry, tart pomegranate juice and wet clay on the nose. The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.",Ryan Cochrane 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Candied—almost confected—red fruit shimmers on the nose. On the palate, this turns into fleshy aromatic red cherry that carries immediate charm. The palate is light, refreshing and full of easy fruit. The finish is clean and reinforces that lovely cherry note.",Stift Klosterneuburg 2014 Steinfeld Pinot Noir (Thermenregion)
"The varietal is unmistakable, with generous amounts of freshly ground black pepper along with lemon twist, herb and raw meat. The medium-bodied palate brings more of the same, with fruit and savory flavors that provide intrigue.",Telaya 2014 Mourvèdre
"This crisp, coastal wine was fermented in half concrete and half stainless steel. It blithely retains plenty of acidity amid its medium-bodied layers of quince, white peach, lemon, forest floor and a touch of dried herb.",Thirty-Seven Wines 2015 Albariño (Sonoma Coast)
"This is an impressive blend of 45% Merlot with 25% estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah from Stagecoach Vineyard and 10% Biale Zinfandel. It comes together seamlessly in a twist of structured blackberry, leathery tannin and tomato leaf, priced to be enjoyed by many.",Jax 2014 Y3 Taureau Red (Napa Valley)
"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle. What's already there is cassis, tar and earth, finishing with a light but balanced fade.",Milbrandt 2007 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope)
"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",Milbrandt 2009 Evergreen Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"At just 12.5% alcohol, this comes across as dry and quite fresh, with vivid grapefruit flesh and acidity. Some mint and lemon flavors sneak in also. The emphasis is clearly on citrus rather than peach or apricot; a fine food wine.",Milbrandt 2009 Traditions Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fresh wine, touched by late harvest richness. Apples, spice and orange zest make for a vividly aromatic series of delicious flavors.",Neumeister 2009 Gelber Muskateller Klassik Gelber Muskateller (Südoststeiermark)
"A crisp style of Riesling, with freshly perfumed green fruits and a steely edge. Flavors of white currants and green plums finish with vivid acidity.",Norbert Bauer 2009 Diermannsee Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"A bit of a letdown after a string of riper, more successful vintages. Feels sharp and somewhat herbal, with a hay or dried wheat edge to the black cherry and rhubarb fruit. Could just be going through a tough period, and might emerge on the other side in 5–6 years.",Testarossa 2008 Niclaire Pinot Noir (California)
"Smoke, ash and graphite notes form an elegant frame to wild berries, orange zest and blue flowers. Cherry wood and mesquite appear in the mouth and the wine is capped by tight, drying tannins.",Angelo Negro & Figli 2006 Sudisfà Riserva  (Roero)
"This youthful expression of Barbera comes forth with ripe and raw aromas of black fruit, plum, prune and wild berries. You really feel the freshness of the fruit here and this wine would pair perfectly with pasta or pizza.",Damilano 2009  Barbera d'Asti
"This is a heavy, full-bodied wine, with the weight of a Rhône variety, perhaps Grenache. Purists will criticize it for lacking the elegance you want in an expensive Pinot Noir. It's dry and tannic, with deep flavors of red currants, cherries, licorice, Canadian bacon and peppery spices. Could develop in the bottle, but it's risky.",Firefly Night 2008 Lone Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Shows the exotic fruitiness of Viognier, with a blast of tangerines, pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples, with flowery honeysuckle and jasmine notes. The wine shows subtle oak notes, but is mainly notable for its forward flavors, elegant dryness and crisply bright acidity.",Kunde 2008 Viognier (Sonoma Valley)
"Almonds and toasted bread combine with lemon and honey flavors in this well-balanced off-dry wine. The acidity reminds you this is Champagne, while keeping fruit and softness right up front.",Louis Barthélémy NV Opale Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
"A soft wine that is full of strawberry fruits to go with a sweet citrus edge. The wine has good acidity, in a light apéritif style with pure final raspberry juice.",Mailly Grand Cru NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"This light and compact Barbaresco Riserva offers ethereal notes of spice, root beer, white berry and wet earth. There's a hint of clove, cinnamon and natural rubber as well and the wine is smooth, polished and firm on the close.",Nada Giuseppe 2005 Casot Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Here's an easy-drinking expression of Nebbiolo that sees 12 months of wood aging in large oak casks for extra spice and tobacco on the finish. Otherwise, the freshness of the fruit is what you taste here backed by bright acidity and firm tannins.",Pioiero 2007  Nebbiolo d'Alba
"This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now.",Riverbench 2008 Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Solid and powerful, it has a great mix of very ripe fruit with dense tannins. Blackberry fruits, laced with licorice and dark chocolate, contrast with a juicy, lightly herbal element. This mainly Merlot wine is destined for a fine future. Drink from 2017.",Château de Roquebrune 2010 Cuvée Reine  (Lalande de Pomerol)
"Coming from the same stable as Léoville las Cases in Saint-Julien, the wine is finely structured with firm tannins and dark fruit. Rich plum flavors are counterbalanced by solid tannins. It needs to age, so drink from 2018.",Château Potensac 2011  Médoc
"A hearty Brunello, it opens with aromas that recall meat juices, leather, mature black fruit cooking spices and turned earth. The juicy palate offers ripe black cherry accented with notes of black pepper, raspberry and lemon thyme with a hint of creamy vanilla. It's velvety soft and already accessible so enjoy soon.",Citille di Sopra 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"This spicy, elegant take on Syrah will reward your attention. Boysenberry and other purple/black fruits are expressed both aromatically and on the palate, with light touches of vanilla. The overall impression is of a pretty, structured, textural wine, with excellent length and balance.",DaMa 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The 2011 and 2012 Chardonnays from DaMa are a study in contrasts, showing how very different the vintages were. Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead.",DaMa 2012 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.",Gamache 2011 Estate Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Half was whole-cluster fermented, yielding dense scents and flavors with black olive, herb and a touch of mocha. Cranberry, raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are smooth and detailed, and the tannins firm and polished.",Amavi 2011 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This earthy wine opens with aromas of meat juices, baking spices and black fruit together with notes of leather and balsam.

Drink 2016–2024.",Bolsignano 2009 Grazia  (Brunello di Montalcino)

Made from late-harvested Chardonnay, it's very sweet in apricots, lemons, vanilla and buttered toast, with a brisk edge of acidity for balance.",Bouchaine 2012 Bouche d'Or Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Since planting in 1997, Bucher Vineyard has been a renowned source of Pinot Noir for exceptional local wineries. Now the Bucher family is making their own wine, with good results. The wine is dry, fresh and keen in acidity, and has considerable weight, with ripe, forward raspberry, cherry, bacon, sautéed wild mushroom and exotic spice flavors. However, it's still too young. Begin to enjoy it around 2018.",Bucher 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"An unlikely but enticing mix of woodsmoke and citrus, of earthiness and lemon oil already hint at the complexity of this nutty wine. A central seam of acidity brings spicy, almost soy-sauce-like savoriness and a bruised-apple edge into focus and suggests that this is best drunk with hearty food.",Johanneshof Reinisch 2012 Spiegel Zierfandler (Thermenregion)
"From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.",Villadoria 2004 Riserva  (Barolo)
"This excellent Merlot speaks to many of Reininger's proven strengths. It's quite smooth and supple, loaded with ripe plum and cherry fruit, seamless and chocolaty. The balance is right on, the length and texture captivating.",Reininger 2010 Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"A pure varietal Syrah, this opens with a mix of peppery herbs, a hint of stem, and a whiff of tomato leaf. Give it some breathing room and the red currant fruit fleshes out, melding with darker flavors of licorice, soy and espresso, in a wine of medium length, with natural acidity and crisp tannins.",Reininger 2010 Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"The proportions favor Grenache 55% to 45%. Four vineyards from three widely different AVAs contributed grapes, yielding compelling aromas of wild berry, raw meat and a brambly character. This is a wine that wants you to take a walk on the wild side, so put on some Lou Reed while you enjoy it.",Syncline 2011 Grenache-Carignan (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aloe vera, green pear peel and ripe Mirabelle plums charm nose and palate on the soft and ripe palate. Despite the ripeness nothing is overdone and reaches a center of gravity.",Tegernseerhof 2012 Bergdistel Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Blackberry, blueberry and creamy vanilla aromas comprise a sweet, chunky, very ripe bouquet. The mouthfeel is full, succulent and bouncy, while flavors of creamy oak, baking spices and black fruits finish with juicy acidity and plenty of wood, chocolate and licorice notes. 150 cases made; drink through 2018.",TeHo 2012 Malbec (Mendoza)

"20% whole-cluster fermented, this rich, brooding blend of Alder Ridge (86%) and Snipes Mountain Grenache brings notes of licorice, dark cherry, black pepper and mortared herbs. It's broad in feel, tart, fruit filled, and tightly wound, needing time in the cellar to unfurl.",Kerloo 2011 Grenache (Horse Heaven Hills)

"Round and velvety, it has aromas of ripe berry, chocolate and exotic spices. The rich palate delivers juicy black cherry punctuated with ground black pepper, cinnamon, carob, pipe tobacco and mint. Forward and sweet, this is already extremely accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.",La Poderina 2008 Poggio Abate Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Made entirely with Syrah, this concentrated wine delivers plum, black pepper, cocoa, coffee, fleshy black cherry and notes of bay leaf. It's plush, soft and savory but it also seems shy on vibrancy and essential energy. Drink sooner rather than later.",Le Macchiole 2010 Scrio Syrah (Toscana)
"An impressive wine, it already shows signs of its potential. It is elegant, with ripe fruits and layers of dark tannins. As it opens, blackberry fruits come through strongly, balancing the firm structure. Drink from 2018.",Château Beaumont 2011  Haut-Médoc
"The estate is under the same ownership as Château la Dominique in Saint-Émilion. This dense wine balances acidity with intense fruitiness. The tannins are now softening, giving a rich structure plus a concentrated leather and spice character. Drink from 2016.",Château Clément-Pichon 2010  Haut-Médoc
"Spicy new wood flavors dominate this otherwise strongly fruity wine. The tension between the two promises a rich, full and ripe wine for the future. There is enough weight, acidity, blackberry fruit and richness to balance out the wood aging. Give this dense wine until 2018.",Château Fonréaud 2011  Listrac-Médoc
"Firm and closed this is a dark and tannic wine, although black currant flavors are also very present. It feels austere with a mineral texture and concentrated final acidity. Drink Lafite's second wine from 2017.",Château Lafite Rothschild 2011 Carruades de Lafite  (Pauillac)

Bright acidity provides lift and balance.",Abbazia di Novacella 2015 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige Valle Isarco)
"Plum, sassafras and dark cherry form a contingency of flavor in this brooding, velvety smooth wine with a sizable finish. Cinnamon and clove are peppered throughout this full-bodied, well-made effort from the famous vineyard site.",Bacigalupi 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Bursting with citrus and savory aromas, this wine is an extrovert that layers spicy, herbal notes on top of ripe and delicious melon and citrus flavors. It has the at-first almost pungent aroma of oak-aged Sauvignon, and slowly reveals more interesting layers of fruit and spice with each sip.",Boatique 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Big Valley District-Lake County)
"Sharp lime skins, rich petrol and yellow grapefruit juice combine for that familiarly fresh Riesling aroma, yet this one is a tad richer, with a lemon pastry note.

Drink soon but slowly to savor the spice.",Bründlmayer 2015 Langenloiser Rosé (Niederösterreich)
"This offers aromas of wild berry, baking spice, toast and a floral note. On the firm palate, notes of vanilla, clove and powdered sage accent a sour cherry core alongside nervous acidity. Close-grained tannins grip the finish. Drink 2018 through 2026.",Vietti 2011 Rocche di Castiglione  (Barolo)
"Ripe blueberries, toasted oak, caramel, brown coffee, black pepper and crushed grape seeds combine for a pleasant smoke and fruit combo on the nose of this bottling.

"Plum clafouti and a marriage of cherry and clove provide a foundation above which lies a spicy mix of dried herb and cedar in this integrated, softly approachable wine of medium-build and length.",Herzog 2012 Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"From a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.",Iron Horse 2013 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (91%) along with pinches of Syrah and Merlot. The aromas of espresso, coffee grounds, fresh herbs and cherry pop, but don't always seem entirely harmonious. The black fruit flavors are more reserved than the aromas might suggest but still deliver.",J. Bookwalter 2013 Chapter 6 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Almost white in color, this wine takes the Provence fashion for light rosé to extremes. To taste, yes, it is a rosé with a light tannic edge and red-currant flavors.

"From an appellation better known for Zin, this blend of 41% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 21% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot works well—a study in chocolate-covered blackberry and blueberry with a powerful firmness balanced by moderate acidity.",Davis Family 2013 Cab 5 Rockpile Ridge Red (Rockpile)
"With 60% Mourvèdre, this blend is rich and spicy. It has great acidity, still fresh and accented by red and citrus fruits.

"This 100% varietal wine was aged in differing levels of oak, from 33% new French to once and twice-used (also French). It makes for a bold presence of thick soft black plum and licorice complemented by long-lasting texture and a length of leather.",Frank Family 2012 Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, cassis, leather and baking spice lift from the glass. On the solid palate, notes of vanilla, cocoa and espresso underscore a core of plum and blackberry.

"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows chalk, slate and wet sand minerality on the nose, alongside Asian pear flesh, kiwi and honeydew fruit notes.

"Vibrant, delicious and tastefully oaky, this wine smells like spearmint, tart apples and buttered toast, with flavors of citrus and crisp white peach. There is some heft in the texture, but it's medium bodied, very supple, and energized by fresh acidity and oak spiciness.",Replica 2014 Chardonnay (California)
"Half Viognier with the rest equal parts Marsanne and Roussanne, it's aromatically expressive with notes of lime zest, honeysuckle, almond and white peach.

"There's a very savory, gamy element on the nose of this wine, which shows wild berries, woody shrubs, rusty iron and turned forest-floor aromas. The palate is punchy at first, with decent acidity and cranberry-plum-raspberry flavors, then clings to a pencil-lead core deeper into the sip. It offers quite a bit of complexity.",Lincourt 2013 Lindsay's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Three barrels were made of this structured, tannic wine that offers a juicy balance between acidity and dark tannins.

"Pungent, spicy earth and cinnamon rise out of the wine's bouquet, inviting one to enjoy a structured expression of cranberry, raspberry and black tea.

"There is a distinct phenolic edge on this earthy, lemon-dominated and taut Riesling. Fruit—apart from citrus—is subsumed into an earthy, tense and concentrated palate. This needs more time to relax into itself and should blossom with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2020.",Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2013 Leimental Riesling (Alsace)
"Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime.

There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Terroir d'Alsace Riesling (Alsace)

"Dark loam and a slate-driven minerality restrain the concentrated black raspberry and black currant ripeness on the nose of this elegant wine, made by a Sonoma-based group co-founded in 1972 by a descendant of tractor-maker John Deere.

"Leafy, spicy, dry berry aromas lead to a jacked up, edgy palate with hard, scraping tannins. Forced woodspice and raw plum flavors finish more spicy than fruity.",Fat Gaucho 2013 Reserva Malbec (Mendoza)
"Damp and furry on the nose, this is all tannins and scratch. High acidity only contributes to the grating mouthfeel, hence it's a bumpy ride where standard berry flavors are a sideshow. Chento 2012 is a better bet if it's still on the shelf.",Bodega Cuarto Dominio 2013 Chento Malbec (Mendoza)
"There's a wild character to the nose of this lean, tart Pinot. It offers aromas and flavors of game, sour cherry, tart raspberry and red currant, framed by soft tannins and a fleeting finish.",Maison de la Villette 2015 Pinot Noir (Vin de France)
"This is a jammy and fruit-forward selection, with direct aromas and flavors of red cherry, berry and plum that are lifted by a hint of menthol. The smooth, easygoing palate offers light tannins and fleshy fruit flavors, followed by a clean but fleeting finish.",Belle Made For You NV Cabernet Sauvignon (Vin de France)
Savory aromas like chicken stock and dried herbs lead to light cucumber flavors and a lean body and dry texture.,Balo 2014 Riesling (Anderson Valley)

"A strange blend of earthy, mulchy berry aromas along with notes of wet cement and Nestlé's Nesquik are hardly impressive. This feels clumsy, with heavy, sticky tannins. Stewy berry flavors and chocolaty oak notes finish as if this was loaded up with cocoa powder.",Arzuaga 2014 La Planta  (Ribera del Duero)
"Horsey berry and vinegar aromas lack freshness and appeal. This feels both tight and dilute, while flavors of forced oak, tomato and tart berry fruits finish drawing and bitter.",Figaro 2013 Tinto Red (Calatayud)

"This blend of 70% Grenache and 30% Carignan is smooth and easy to drink, with friendly aromas and flavors of red cherry and raspberry that are kissed by a hint of mentholated character. The tannins and low and the finish is short; drink up.",Belle Made For You NV Red (Vin de France)
"Lightly spicy, this soft wine has a zesty tang of orange and bright strawberries that are ripe and gently fruity. The wine is open, ready to drink.",Château de Saint Martin 2015 No 2 de Saint-Martin Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This is an oddly perfumed and puckering wine, with not much to say in the way of fruit, the oak treatment suggestive of oak chips.",Housley's Century Oak 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"There's an initial astringency to the bouquet of this wine, presented in scents of red-cherry skin, apple and raspberry leaf. The palate offers more of the same, with bitter tannins and fruit-skin flavors that lead into a finish reminiscent of oversteeped black tea.",L.

"A frankly sweet wine, this has a deep pink color, simple floral and fruity aromas and a smooth, soft texture.",Naggiar 2014 Estate Rosé (Sierra Foothills)

"This rusty-looking rosé smells rustic, with cherry and raspberry notes. In the mouth, it registers as full-bodied, while the flavor profile is chunky and dry, with early signs of oxidation that are confirmed on a low-steam finish. Drink right away.",Real Compañia de Vinos 2013 Rosado (Spain)
The wine shows considerable wood aging flavors as well as the sweet toffee and fruit flavors. The wood spice is too dominant and throws the rest of the wine out of balance.,Quinta do Portal NV 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port)
"A simple, fruity wine, this offers attractive citrus flavors and a ripe texture. Yellow fruits add richness while the acidity shoots through at the end.",Domaine Chatelain 2013  Petit Chablis

"There is a curious petrol aroma to this wine. It follows through to toast, spice and flavors that only hint at fruit but that do bring out very fresh acidity. The aftertaste is the freshest part of the wine.",Caves Transmontanas 2010 Vértice Cuvée Reserva Brut Sparkling (Douro)
"Tropical-fruit aromas highlight the Moscatel in this blend. The palate is plump and melony in feel, with melon, peach and lychee flavors. The finish is soft and doesn't show a lot of acidity or cut.",Epilogo 2013 Sauvignon Blanc-Moscatel White (La Mancha)
"Aromas are leafy and scratchy, also suggesting cement. This feels resiny and creamy in the mouth. Flavors of woody, generic berry fruits finish hot and scratchy.",Finca Flichman 2013 Misterio Malbec (Mendoza)
Melon and tropical-fruit aromas precede a juice-like palate that struggles with mouthfeel. Flavors of mealy apple and peach finish with melon and green banana notes. Overall this is just good enough to enjoy as a quaffer.,Santa Ana 2013 Reserve Chardonnay (Mendoza)

"Aromas of generic red fruits and children's vitamins are the greeting. This is chunky in feel, with light acidity that tries to keep things from coming across cloying. Candied flavors could use more dryness and elegance, while the finish is sweet and tastes of brown sugar and berry syrup.",Pittacum 2013 Tres Obispos Mencía Rosado (Bierzo)

"This smells flowery but also flabby and oily. The palate has a creamy, tropical feel to it and flavors of melon, papaya and powdered sugar. A soft, lightly bitter-tasting finish could use more pop, scour and balance.",Bodega Atamisque 2013 Serbal Viognier (Tupungato)

"Grown in high-elevation vineyards at 1,800 feet, this crisp white is a blend of five of the familiar Douro varieties, emphasizing brightness as well as soft fruitiness.

"This full-bodied red opens with aromas suggesting French oak, raspberry jam coconut and exotic spice. The densely concentrated assertive palate offers licorice, dried cherry, tart cranberry and powdered sage while astringent grainy tannins provide an austere framework. You'll also detect the heat of evident alcohol.",Revello Fratelli 2013 Cerretta  (Barolo)
"There are some curious, almost Syrah-like elements to this bottling from a rural region between Santa Clarita and Palmdale, but it's an interesting wine.

"From one of the Riboli family's new estate vineyards, this bottling is a clean but quite ripe style of Viognier, with blousy aromas of tuberose, coconut and guava. It's tighter on the palate, with honeydew, key lime and guava sorbet flavors.",San Simeon 2016 Stefano Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Quite yellow in the glass, this solid bottling of a tough-to-master grape shows rich aromas of dried lemon peel, beeswax, smoke, nut oil and sandstone on the nose. The viscous palate offers dried pears, seared lemons and a hint of salinity—elements that will continue to converge and gain nuance with cellar time.",Tercero 2014 Camp 4 Vineyard Marsanne (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This is everything a Valpolicella should be: fresh, savory and incredibly easy to drink.

"Dried herb aromas are at the fore, along with notes of flowers and red fruit. The palate is full of medium-bodied fruit and savory flavors that bring a lightly tacky lip-smacking feel.

"This wine is a blend of 52% Syrah, 26% Mourvèdre and 22% Grenache. Aromas of black licorice, herb, barrel spice and cassis are out front. The palate is chock-full of black fruit flavors that bring a dry, lightly astringent feel.",Andrew Rich 2014 Glacial Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sturdy and flavorful, this is a well-made, dry and moderately tannic wine that smells beefy, salt-and-peppery, and tastes juicy like raspberries and cherries with a little bit of meatiness coming through for complexity. The texture has good grip and acidity so the wine will pair well with big proteins.",Beringer 2015 Founders' Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"With more tannic grip than usual, and plenty of ripe black-cherry flavors, this is an enjoyable, full-bodied wine that will pair nicely with rich food. Made from Malbec, Petit Verdot and Petite Sirah, the wine's texture benefits from fine-grained tannins that balance the powerful fruit flavors quite well.",Black's Station 2015 Red (Yolo County)

"Almost as a challenge, owners Pascal et Jean-Marc Verhaeghe set out to prove that Malbec could produce a fine Port-style fortified wine.

It's very juicy and approachable, but a tad sweet.",Nicora 2014 G-S-M (Central Coast)

"This is a challenging wine, but it takes bravery to make Pinot Grigio like a red wine, using amphorae and terra cotta along the way. It's pink, but not a rose. Zesty aromas of tangerine, wet stone and grapefruit skins also show a bit of yeast. There is strong kumquat tang to the sip, which is fairly sour without the ripeness one might expect from the color.",Giornata 2015 Ramato Quattro Bassi Ranch Vineyard Pinot Grigio (San Luis Obispo)
"The integrated nose with peach, melon and stony aromas is clean and vital. This weighs in on the full, round and heavy side, while flavors of orange and grapefruit are good but monotone. A briny citrusy finish closes this out. Drink now.",Gotas de Mar 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)

"An awkward, unbalanced wine. Has green, vegetal flavors alongside sweet candied raspberries.",Cline 2009 Zinfandel (California)

"Smells like wet dog, with sweaty red fruit. The palate is high in acid and low in volume, with snappy, semisour flavors of raspberry and red plum. Settles on the finish but still it's sharp and lean. 80% Tempranillo and 20% Malbec.",2 Copas 2009 Red (Mendoza)

"Here's a sweet white wine (the term Amabile refers to the high sugar content) that opens with compelling notes of honey, acacia flower, peach and yellow candy. It's hard to imagine what to pair it with: It could either go with fruit salad or salty crackers with cheese.",Bigi 2009 Amabile  (Orvieto Classico)
A rather dull nose does not want to reveal much. The palate counters this with freshness and a rosehip tartness that has some bitter-edged redcurrant charm. This is fresh and easy and would also work as a chilled red.,Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Les Princes Abbés Pinot Noir (Alsace)

Some excellent elements, including a lush yet structured mouthfeel, but some tasters will find the intense pine-bough flavor distracting.",Torii Mor 1998 Balcombe Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Really nicely balanced, this is a big, sleek cruiser with lemon, earth and green-apple aromas and flavors. Full, yet trim and clean, it shows the tautness of youth but has fine essential fruit and a lengthy, crisp finish. Possesses excellent, if somewhat unopened elements, and may well rate higher if cellared for a few years",Vranken 1995 Demoiselle Cuvée 21  (Champagne)
"Snappy and full of raspberry and cedar aromas. It’s mouthfilling and juicy, with a stylish lean edge to it. Puckery on the palate, with a right-on mix of acidity, fruit and oak. It delivers the goods, not missing a twist or turn along the way, and in the final analysis, it’s fairly large, packing a solid punch of berry fruit.",Erath 1998 Vintage Select Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Quite Burgundian in nature, this offering is not opulent, but is very well defined, with an almost etched nature. Lean, with tart cherry, licorice and mineral aromas and flavors, and fairly light in body, it is big on character and traditonal Pinot style. The wine is quite taut now, but the finish is very long and complex. Should be beautiful with three to five years’ aging.",Evesham Wood 1998 Temperance Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Dough, vanilla, apple and citrus aromas open to a smooth palate offering similar flavors with smoky, spicy accents. Quite fizzy; there’s a slightly soft quality to it, and a tangy element enters on the finish of this charming easy drinker.",De Saint Gall 1995 Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut  (Champagne)
"Light straw in color, with fine bubbles and pure, fine aromas of peach and strawberry. In the mouth, it’s exceptionally rich and creamy. It’s not quite as sweet as an extra dry Champagne, but it’s definitely heading in that direction.",Iron Horse 1995 Russian Cuvée  (Sonoma County)
"A burly surprise from southern Oregon; there are flowery, almost honeyed elements to the black-fruit nose. It scores big points in the mouthfeel category—it’s round, chewy and creamy. Oak is a giant factor here; you’d better like mounds of toasty wood. If you do, the plump plummy fruit will make your day. But stand clear of this hefster if you prefer elegant, streamlined Pinot Noir.",Bear Creek 1998 Pinot Noir (Rogue Valley)
"Blackberry, herb, tobacco and a menthol note mark the nose of this full but not heavy red. The fruit is ripe, sweet and unburdened by excess oak. The long, juicy cherry and licorice finish sports no hard tannins. Lovely for drinking now.",Heritage Road 1998 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast)
"Compared to the Mazzoni, this baby has less fruity but pepperier, earthier aromas, and herbal ones, too: licorice and chocolate, although there’s some deeply scented blackberry. It seems crisper and more angular, and more tannic, with a great hidden depth of fruit that needs to be coaxed out through short-term aging.",Kenwood 1997 Nuns Canyon Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Has bright, focused aromas, including lime and raspberry, with nutty, smoky bread dough and yeast. Very clean, with a pronounced kiss of sweet berry fruit. Finishes slightly sweet.",Robert Hunter 1994 Brut de Noirs  (Sonoma Valley)
"An elegant, pale-golden color leads to subtle but refined aromas of bread dough and lime, and a tantalizing hint of—what? Mint? Raspberry? White chocoloate? The same flavors commingle in the mouth. It’s very dry and acidic now. A year or so might soften it.",Roederer Estate NV Brut  (Anderson Valley)
"Toast and yeast on the otherwise lime-scented bouquet. Clean citrus and green-apple flavors lead into a zesty, smooth soda-like finish. Overall it’s just a nice, clean, bright Champagne, one that has the right level of dryness and zip.",G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne)
"The very ripe and sweet cherry aromas and flavors bear handsome notes of tarragon and smoke. Full and round on the palate, this wine displays a lengthy finish with dark cherry, bitter-chocolate and herb flavors. Quite appealing now and very easy to get comfy with.",Stonecroft 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Each year Rich gets his grapes from different sources: This time it’s Corral Creek, and the wine’s tight as a drum, emphasizing cranberry and pie cherries. It isn’t sour, but it is tart. The gorgeous nose and precise, powerful red-berry fruit make it pleasurable. Puckering acids say it should be served with food.",Andrew Rich 1998 Les Vigneaux Corral Creek Vyd Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"For those who like their Pinot oaky, this may be just the ticket. It starts out with caramel, coffee and chocolate aromas skillfully matched with sour cherries and a bouquet garni of green herbs. It then turns ever oakier on the palate, with a near-syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with toasty oak-driven spice notes and an herbaceous edge.",Argyle 1998 Spirit House Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Starts with a nice gold-straw color and lots of fine, tiny bubbles. The aroma is rich and creamy, marked by pear and apple notes, vanilla and bread dough. Very dry, with evident ripe fruit and a dry, leesy finish. The texture’s a bit rough, but this may age out in a few years.",Handley 1994 Blanc De Blancs  (Anderson Valley)
"Attractive fragrance and a pleasureable mouthfeel characterize this medium-weight offering. A 50-50 Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc blend, it offers  pear, lemon, and vanilla-oak flavors on the nose and mouth. The long smooth finish is unexpectedly elegant, something not often found at this price. Best Buy.",Calvet 1998 Reserve  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Bright in color and full of snappy cherries on the nose. This cherry-dominated profile follows suit on the palate, where the fruit-to-wood-balance swings in favor of the crisp, dry fruit. Charged-up acids provide a jolt, as do the full tannins. It seems to have the right structure to age for a few years.",Tualatin Estate 1998 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Dark in color, almost pure purple; the bouquet carries some heavy oak, with aromas of toast and vanilla. It’s also a little sauvage. Rich and chocolaty, but also quite sweet. It’s deep and woody overall—the vanilla and oak are very prominent, maybe too much so for many people.",Cristom 1998 Louise Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Chocolate and plum mingle enticingly in this medium-bodied offering from the warm (relative to Willamette) Umpqua Valley. Subtle herb notes and a peppery, crisp finish keep this wine interesting from start to finish.",Girardet 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"From a bubbly specialist comes this fancy wine, a blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay. Has very forward fruity aromas that are a combo of both varietals. It’s a bit rough, as though the bubbles aren’t fine enough, but that’s comparing it to the best French vintage Champagne, which costs a whole lot more.",Handley 1995 Brut  (Anderson Valley)
"Fruit-forward is the best way to describe this juicy, totally accessible red. Rich berry flavors, just a faint meaty-leathery note for a touch of complexity, and a smooth even finish complete the package. Best Buy.",Heritage Road 1998 Shiraz (South Australia)
"Marked by strong, bright citrus and vanilla aromas, and a waft of freshly kneaded bread dough and toast, this charming wine has limeade flavors with a toasty finish. It’s dry and has class and refinement.",Gloria Ferrer 1992 Royal Cuvee Brut  (Carneros)
"This organic bottling marks Cooper’s 20th year, and it’s a tantalizing, high-strung, dusty wine, with a true Pinot nose full of raspberries and cinnamon. Plenty of verve on the palate, which emphasizes fruit and more fruit. The frame is sleek, but it capably carries the wine’s zip.",Cooper Mountain 1998 20th Anniversary Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A nice young, jammy Zin with zesty aromas of blackberry jam and briary fruit, meaning it’s like the scent of wild berries on a hot summer day. A lovely wine with pretty fruit, but it’s most notable for the soft, plush, opulent tannins.",Fetzer 1997 Barrel Select Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
"Smells like a briar patch under summer sun, with accents of leather and tomato. The pungent aromatics fade into a weighty mouthfeel. It’s all red berries, and it’s tight and young. Shows fine structure and a pure quality. A very likable wine.",Elk Cove 1998 Windhill Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Rustic, with some smoke and char up front that gives way to intense berry flavors. It’s a touch idiosyncratic—it’s very concentrated and a bit sauvage—as it shows a lot of vineyard individuality. Hard and rugged now; a few years in the bottle should tame its power.",Adelsheim 1998 Bryan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"A bold, pure nose of strawberries and cherries is bright and lively, spiced with a faint green-herb note. A bit soft and even sweet-tasting, but that only adds to its easy-drinking charm.",Moët & Chandon NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Hooray! A terrific Zin that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. It’s loaded with personality, with quintessential aromas and flavors of wild berries and spices, and added complexities of roasted coffeebean, anise and white chocolate. Best Buy.",Valley of the Moon 1997 Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Black-skinned berry, menthol, aromatic herb and dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this generous red. The firm palate shows juicy black cherry, fleshy plum, clove, sage and black pepper. It's sleek and balanced, with polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",Principe Corsini 2012 Le Corti  (Chianti Classico)
"This wine is ripe, round, and fruity wine. It is refreshing and lively on the midpalate, with a crisp citrus note on the finish. Created by Producta Vignobles, a cooperative wine group.",Producta Vignobles 2014 La Cabane aux Oiseaux Rosé (Bordeaux Rosé)
"Ripe, rich black cherry and plum flavors are struck by ripples of coffee, dried herbs and granite in this elegant, structured Cabernet Franc. Crisp acidity and fine grained tannins frame a moderately long finish.",Raphael 2013 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Deep pink in the glass, this wine has a nose of strawberries and freesia. It is full in the mouth, with flavors of strawberry, tart cranberry, bitter almond and lavender. Soft but ever-present tannins are felt through the tart but pleasant finish.",Recanati 2014 Rosé (Galilee)

"Intensely ripe gooseberry and white grapefruit flavors are cut by a razor's edge of acidity in this juicy, bracing Sauvingnon Blanc. Fermented using indigenous yeasts, it's brisk on the finish, ending on a distinctly saline, mineral tone.",Bedell 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Aromas of baked plum, coconut, scorched earth and oak emerge in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, oak-driven spice, licorice and tobacco alongside firm but fine-grained tannins. Drink 2016–2021.",Bindi Sergardi 2011 Mocenni Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"This is a bit clipped on the nose, with notes of saline, seashell, metal, leather and earthy blackberry. The palate feels wide and a touch wayward, while leathery berry and plum flavors include a note of mushroom. Lemony oak and herbal notes rise up on the finish.",Bodega San Pedro Regalado 2011 Embocadero  (Ribera del Duero)
"This 90% Sangiovese, 5% Merlot and 5% Colorino blend opens with aromas that recall forest floor, dark berry and a whiff of toast.

"Aromas of menthol, underbrush, scorched soil, licorice and ripe plum lead the nose.

It closes on a coffee note.",Cantalici L'Antica Fornace di Ridolfo 2012 Baruffo  (Chianti Classico)
"Made with Sangiovese and 5% Canaiolo, this medium-bodied red initially opens with rather funky aromas that eventually burn off in the glass to reveal dark berry, tilled soil and a whiff of baking spice. The ripe palate offers juicy wild cherry, ground pepper, dried aromatic herb and an earthy note of game alongside smooth tannins.",Castellare di Castellina 2012 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"A full-bodied mix of Sangiovese and 5% Merlot, this offers aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, dark cooking spice, menthol and tobacco. On the firm, forward palate, notes of clove, peppercorn and anise accent the core of dried black cherry. Assertive, fine-grained tannins provide the framework.",Castello di Gabbiano 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"More of a Zinfandel than a red blend, this has plenty of flavor and more tannin than usual. Containing 40% Petite Sirah, it offers a surplus of juicy plum and black cherry flavors, good balance and just enough grippy tannin to make it robust.",Cedarville Vineyard 2012 The Rules of Fair Play Red (Fair Play)
"Ripe and immediately attractive, this is an apple and lime flavored wine. Weight from the Pinots in the blend gives a rich, full-bodied backdrop. There is just a hint of toast in this bottling, showing it is very ready to drink.",Charles Ellner NV Qualité Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"This wine is still a baby, pudgy and withdrawn, yet still it imparts enough herbal and black cherry to be inviting and promising. It retains the girth of tannins expected in a youthful wine, but is already integrative in oak. Let it open for the full effect.",Slingshot 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This blend of 40% Mourvèdre, 30% Syrah, 21% Grenache and 9% Counoise shows a dense core of fruit on the fresh, tart nose, with blueberry, blackberry and boysenberry, as well as lava rocks and a licorice lift. The palate is all about texture, with good acidity and grip containing the purple fruit flavors",Tablas Creek 2012 Espirit de Tablas Red (Paso Robles)

"Both fresh green and ripe yellow pear make an appearance on the nose, along with a subtle hint of pineapple candy. The palate is more crisp than expected—in line with the 2014 vintage—but provides ample refreshment and citrus zing. If you like zippy you'll love this.",Direder 2014 Donatus Grüner Veltliner (Wagram)
"An oaky opening with aromas of coconut, dried cheese, herbs, wood resin and berry fruits introduces a fresh, healthy palate with power but also resiny stickiness.

"Made completely from Merlot, this wine comes from Candy Mountain (52%), Birch Creek (25%) and Bacchus vineyards.

Flavors are light yet concentrated, with the tannins showing some astringency.",Forgeron 2012 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"All coming from Stillwater Creek Vineyard, this leads with aromas of green herbs, dark fruit and milk chocolate. It's hedonistic in style with layers of fruit flavors and tart acids that seem a bit out of place.",Foundry Vineyards 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Deep straw in color, this low alcohol (6%) wine has a nose of lime sorbet, lilac and orange blossom. It offers flavors of lime sorbet, white peach, honey, orange blossom and Turkish delight.

"Leafy, herbal aromas blend with green notes and more typical blackberry and plum scents. This has a sharp, high-acid mouthfeel and grabby, angular flavors of currant and boysenberry.

The palate is supple and complex, showing dynamic spices and herbs, cut olives, savory meats and pipe smoke, much like a Middle Eastern tagine.",Brave & Maiden 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Named after the city of Evora, capital of Alentejo and close to the winery, this is a finely made impressive wine. While it is rich, it's ripe, smooth and packed with berry fruits as well as balanced tannins. It is still developing and although it can be drunk soon, it will be better aged for several more years. Ideally, wait until 2018.",Cartuxa 2011 Foral de Evora Tinto Colheita Red (Alentejo)
"Red berry, pressed rose and balsamic aromas lead the nose. The structured palate offers juicy black cherry, grilled herb, licorice, clove and a hint of mocha accompanied by firm, velvety tannins and fresh acidity.",Paolo Manzone 2011 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"This impressive wine dances in hearty clove and cinnamon sparked by a floral bouquet of rose. High-toned, structured and elegant, it has subtle power and concentration but remains fresh in the glass. Drink now through 2020.",William Hill Estate 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a very pure wine, all fruit and tight acidity. It is classic Chablis with its tangy, steely edge that gives a lift and structure to the crisp apple fruit flavors. The acidity cuts right through the wine, leaving a refreshing, lively aftertaste.",Domaine Chenevières 2014 Côte de Lechet Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Light while also intense with good acidity and unctuous honey flavors, this is already a delicious wine, even though it is young. Ripe orange and lemon go with the honey to give a fine wine that could be drunk now, although that would be a shame. It would be much better to wait until 2017. With just over 200 acres of vines, Quarts de Chaume is a tiny enclave in the Layon Valley.",Domaine des Baumard 2011  Quarts de Chaume
"Subdued but classic Nebbiolo aromas of red berry, crushed rose, scorched earth and a balsamic note emerge on this full-bodied wine. The tight palate offers wild cherry, black raspberry, chopped mint and licorice supported by a backbone of fresh acidity and firm tannins.",Francesco Rinaldi 2011 Cannubi  (Barolo)
"With the goal of adding subtle aromatics and structure, this wine was given eight months in 50% new French oak puncheons, with the other 50% in neutral. The wine intrigues as much as refreshes, with crisp acidity and bright sparks of citrus prominent. Medium bodied, it has a complexity of baked apple and pear lurking in the background.",Gary Farrell 2013 Rochioli-Allen Vineyards Oak Puncheon Fermented Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This opens with earthy aromas of ripe dark fruit, scorched earth, game and truffle. The concentrated palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, sweet cake spice, tobacco and herb accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins and a vein of fresh acidity.",Giovanni Rosso 2011 del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba  (Barolo)
"Translating to “The Boss's Red,” this blend of 50% Zinfandel and 50% Merlot is a bomber, with aromas of violet-laced fudge cake, ginger snaps, stewed black cherries, vanilla and sarsaparilla. The palate is all about purple flavors, with ginger-molasses spice as well as lifting spearmint and lilacs.",Oso Libre 2011 Rojo del Patron Red (Paso Robles)
"Rose petals, pomegranate, dried strawberry, a hint of tar and dried herbs combine for a complex nose on this bottling from the Lompoc-based winery. There is bright acidity on the palate, with cranberry, black pepper, coffee and cherry-pit flavors.",Pali 2013 Rancho La Vina Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Despite its low alcohol, this is the most complex and compelling of Panther Creek's 2013 Pinots. Aromatic, with entwined scents of cocoa powder, rose petals and earth, it is delicate but beautifully defined with raspberry/cherry fruit, underscored with wet stone. It is a graceful wine with a decade of life ahead. Drink now through 2025.",Panther Creek 2013 Lazy River Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Structured and balanced, this opens with aromas of dark berry, violet, menthol and spice. The focused palate doles out juicy black cherry, ripe strawberry, ground pepper, anise and chopped herb against a backdrop of closely-knit, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2028.",Paolo Scavino 2011 Carobric  (Barolo)
"Black pepper, blackberry and beef char give a savory style to this bottling, which also has lighter touches of violets and other purple flowers.

"Cherry-berry crumble topped with vanilla cream gives this wine a brambly, succulent quality, dusted in light cinnamon spice, cedar and well-integrated tannin and oak. Powerful and full-bodied, it's fruity, balanced and enjoyable now.",Raymond 2012 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Zin specialist Artezin gets into the Petite Sirah game with this enormously ripe, fruity wine.

"The entry-level wine from Esclans is more like what you might expect from a Provençal rosé, offering crisp berry and peach fruit and a mouthwatering finish.",Château d'Esclans 2007 Whispering Angel Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"From Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, this wine shows richness, white fruits and some herbaceousness. Currently, there is an earthy edge to the wine, slightly coarse, likely to benefit from two years' aging. It is definitely for food.",Château Lynch-Bages 2007 Blanc de Lynch-Bages  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"A strong effort from Vavasour's second label, the 2008 Dashwood SB features vibrant aromas of crushed tomato leaf and hints of jalapeño and flavors of green tomato and gooseberry. It's medium in body and slightly creamy in texture, with a crisp, fruit-driven finish.",Dashwood 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Among Erath's dizzying array of single vineyard and other designated Pinot Noirs, it is almost impossible to single out the real players. This is a very appealing bottle, loaded with cherry fruit and lots of chocolaty oak. Forward, smooth and ready to go.",Erath 2006 Hyland Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This makes an interesting contrast with the 2002 vintage, also currently on release. The 2000 is softer, more open, sweeter, certainly less vivid and concentrated. Its creamy texture has attractive fresh pear and white currant fruits, followed by red apple acidity. Drink now.",Pascal Doquet 2000 Le Mont Aimé Premier Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"A rather refined, restrained version of Marlborough Sauvignon, with slightly herbal overtones to the strone fruit and citrus flavors. It's round, with no rough edges, yet retains a clean, mouth-watering finish.",Saint Clair 2008 Pioneer Block #3 43 Degrees Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"The top Australian Cabernets retain distinct varietal character without veering into overly green territory. This one features hints of mint and tobacco alongside cassis and coffee. The texture is a treat: creamy at first, then firming up on the finish. Drink now-2015.",Taltarni 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Pyrenees)
"Really good wine with blasting dark fruit, wintergreen, herbs and tobacco aromas. This blend of 66% Syrah with 17% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère is tight, tannic and serious; the mouth has roasted, savory black-fruit flavors along with tobacco, and the finish is smooth and chocolaty. Except for the slightest hint of green on the nose and midpalate, this is a winner.",Antiyal 2006 Kuyen Red (Maipo Valley)
"Importer Bobby Kacher seemingly has a pipeline to the best rosés around Nîmes, and Mas des Bressades is a perennial favorite. The 2008 features layers of ripe fruit--berries and peaches--brought together in a lush, full-bodied but not overblown wine. Drink now.",Mas des Bressades 2008 Cuvée Tradition Rosé (Costières de Nîmes)
"With a ruby-crimson color, this sparkling wine is as full-bodied as a Pinot Noir, but with bubbles. It has flavors of strawberries, vanilla and yeast, and is dry and clean. Nice with ahi tuna tartare.",Frank Family NV Rouge Sparkling (Napa Valley)
"Soft and gentle, this is a Zin to drink right now for its lush, exotic flavors. It's dry, with dusty tannins and mouth-filling tastes of ripe crushed blackberries and cherries, baked into a pie and sprinkled with cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper, with a pinch of salt.",Hobo 2007 Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Here's a Dry Prosecco (in other words, sweeter) from the Cartizze cru that plays its sweet fruit flavors against attractive mineral notes. It's an elegant and balanced sparkler with an easy approach and cheerful notes of jasmine, honeysuckle and stone fruit. The mouthfeel is tonic and sharp with crisp acidity.",Le Colture NV Cartizze  (Prosecco Superiore di Cartizze)
"This has been a good bottling for Brassfield. It shows classic mountain intensity, with explosive currant, wild berry, mocha, pine cone, anise and pepper flavors, tucked into firm, sweet tannins. Could benefit from 2 or 3 years in the cellar.",Brassfield 2005 Round Mountain Volcano Zinfandel (High Valley)
"Ripe, creamy and decidedly fruity, this has a big waft of herbaceous, citrus and green plum flavors that are all up front and delicious. The wood element gives spice, offering a base for the fruit and giving good balance, and a vibrant, clean aftertaste.",Château du Seuil 2007  Graves
"Powerful and rich, from superripe grapes, this wine follows a style in Bordeaux that seems to want to make white Burgundy. It is creamy, rounded, spicy from toast, with white fruits, only a touch of citrus, and a full, intense aftertaste.",Château Tour de Mirambeau 2007  Bordeaux Blanc
"Succulent and opulent, with ripe pineapple purée, Meyer lemon tart, kiwi fruit, pastry crust and tangy mineral flavors, enriched with the buttered toast and caramel of new oak.",Cinnabar 2006 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"The name refers to the fact that the wine was both fermented and aged in stainless steel barrels. Made with Dijon clones from two different vineyards, it's fruit-driven, nicely flavored, offering melon, apple and white peach in equal proportion. It's a well-balanced wine, with clean, fresh flavors and just the right amount of acid to keep you reaching for the next glass.",Boedecker Cellars 2007 Purity Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"With its ripe, yellow fruit flavors, this is a gentle, soft, open wine, which offers immediately pleasure. There is more: the spice from the wood and the pear skin and nutmeg element adding complexity. That suggests aging for 2–3 years, possibly more. But also enjoy now.",Château de Cruzeau 2007  Pessac-Léognan
"A lovely bottle, carefully crafted from vines approaching 40 years of age. A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months. Apples and pears, melon and grapefruit all seem to have been mixed in with wet stones; the wine makes a fresh and delicate impression with as much mineral and fruit. Stylish and lacy.",Daedalus Cellars 2007 Maresh Vineyard Riesling (Dundee Hills)
"Despite displaying less power and weight than the top wine from Rimauresq, this wine shows a delicious sense of harmony and crispness. Peach and lemon flavors are underscored by firm minerality. Good value.",Rimauresq 2007 Petit Rimauresq Grenache-Cinsault Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"A rich, soft, well- balanced wine. There is crispness, but this is given character by toast from some good bottle age, at least in the sample tasted here. The wine is suffused with white fruit flavors, which give a soft, creamy aftertaste.",Jacquart NV Brut de Nominé  (Champagne)
"This is only just rosé, its onion skin color as pale as possible. The wine has some red fruit flavors, but it is more about toast, yeast and a lively, smooth finish. Worth considering with salamis or ham, as well as salmon.",Louis Barthélémy NV Pink Brut  (Champagne)

"With its pretty pale peach color and strawberry, orange peel and herb aromas, this is dry and broad. Tart citrus flavors provide backing.",The Conqueror 2016 Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills)

Lean in style and delicate in concentration, it's a crisp and elegant sip. Firm, fine tannins accentuate the finish.",T'Jara 2013 Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"A salmon color and aromas of cantaloupe, peach and grape skins lead to a tight but pulpy palate. Fleshy peach and papaya flavors, like the nose, come with a sense of skins. A round, chewy finish is bold and fairly serious.",Urbina 2016 Rosado (Rioja)
"Here's a lively red dessert wine with ripe black-skinned fruit and candied orange zest aromas. The medium sweet, frothy palate offers blackberry jam, cake spice and confectionary notes alongside fresh acidity.",Villa di Corlo NV Amabile  (Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro)

"Saucy plum and berry aromas are a touch stewy and gritty. This wine shows a blocky body with sinewy tannins. Savory, saucy flavors match the bouquet, and it feels supple and tastes roasted on the finish.",Viña Mayor 2014 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Curious whiffs of raspberry and pink grapefruit lend a particularly fruity, forward tone to this medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's easy drinking and plush in mouthfeel but brightened by sunny grapefruit and tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2019.",Wölffer 2015 Chardonnay (Long Island)

"Dark cherry and berry fruits lead the nose of this rich and bramby wine, with hints of spicy chocolate and raspberry sauce lending added decadence.

"Dense and dark in color, this leads with jammy, superripe scents of blackbery, plum and cherry preserves, hit by a touch of bramble.

"There's a strong peachy scent to the nose of this bottling, but it's bolstered by sea salt and a scratched lime-skin freshness. The lime flavor is prominent on the sip, from pith to juice, and there is decent tension along with honeydew flavors.",Midnight 2016 Chardonnay
"The Lollipop Hill designation seems rounder and fuller on the palate than the producer's Special Reserve Tocai. It's not deeply concentrated, but offers shades of ripe yellow apple, plum and lemon flavors. Soft tangerine acidity brightens the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.",Millbrook 2016 Lollipop Hill Estate Bottled Tocai Friulano (Hudson River Region)

"This 100% varietal wine leads with woodspice, green herb and flower aromas and follows with sweet, vanilla-laced black fruit flavors. Although aged entirely in used French oak, the barrel influence is prominent. The tannins bring dryness, needing food to ease their grit.",Finn Hill 2013 Tenebrae Stillwater Creek Vineyard Petit Verdot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Steely mineral and brisk grapefruit notes combine in this spry, cutting Grüner Veltliner. It's dry in style, with delicate concentration but loads of refreshment. The finish is touched with nut and earth tones. Drink now through 2019.",Fulkerson 2016 William Vigne Grüner Veltliner (Seneca Lake)

"Initial weedy, herbaceous aromas give way to more waxy stone-fruit scents. In the mouth, this is razor sharp and sky high in acidity. Pithy, sharp flavors of green apple, lemon and underripe peach finish tangy, much like white pineapple.",Mendel 2014 Semillon (Mendoza)
"Initial grassy aromas of hay and wheat usher in scents of peach, melon and saline water. This is a bit pulpy on the palate, but with cutting acidity.

"This nervy and vibrant wine takes time to reveal the intriguing flavors within.

The vibrant, elegant palate delivers layers of creamy Granny Smith apple, nectarine zest and steely mineral balanced by bright acidity.",Elena Walch 2013 Castel Ringberg Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"This Syrah-led blend delivers a blast of asphalt, cherry cough drop, licorice and raw oak on the nose. The palate is cushioned and ripe, but with solid acidity. Flavors of baked, loamy berry fruits are spicy and slightly medicinal, while the finish is woody, with related flavors of vanilla and caramel. This also contains 19% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Tempranillo.",Flaherty 2012 Red (Aconcagua Valley)
"Still stark and taut, this dry, delicately framed Riesling has beauty within its subtleties. Hints of lemon, lime, honey and blossom flutter on the palate against a backdrop of steely minerals and piercing acidity. It's subdued in its elegance, but should become more profound by holding until 2020–2022 for maturation.",Fritz Haag 2013 Juffer Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel)
"Earth, pepper and spice aromas go well with core plum and cherry scents. In the mouth, this is chewy, round and well balanced, with red plum, raspberry, spice and carob flavors. A woody, lightly herbal, spicy finish with fresh but lasting berry notes is a good conclusion.",Ventisquero 2011 Grey Glacier Single Block Trinidad Vineyard Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"Suggestive of smoked duck, which would make a good pairing, this wine offers toasted oak around a core of raspberry-rhubarb compote, slightly complemented in herb. Velvety on the palate, it's well-composed, earthy and bright.",VML 2012 Floodgate Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Dark, sappy and smoky, this engaging wine offers substantial cassis and blueberry fruit, dotted with highlights of caraway and dark chocolate. The tannins are beautifully polished, and the wine should have further improvement ahead as it ages through 2020.",WildAire 2012 Ellis Vineyards Tempranillo (Rogue Valley)
This is a bold and ripely fruity wine. Fine tannins and blackberry fruits are already well combined in a big and juicy whole. The wine does have a structure and layers of wood aging that suggest it will age. Drink from 2018.,Wines & Winemakers 2012 Abreu Callado Reserva  Red (Alentejano)
"Aromas of white flower, tropical fruit and peach mingle in the glass. The round, juicy palate offers stone fruit, green apple and mineral alongside bright acidity. The lingering finish has a note of ginger drop.",Ottella 2014  Lugana
"This mature wine is beginning to dry out with its dark tannins and leather texture. A complex wine, it's on the point of losing its fruitiness, giving a firm structure along with juicy acidity at the end. Drink now.",Perescuma 2007 Orquestra Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Delicate aromas of white spring blossom, citrus and orchard fruit waft from the glass. The round palate delivers white peach, creamy green apple, lemon drop and and a hint of vanilla brightened by fresh acidity. A mineral note marks the finish.",Pratello 2012 Il Rivale  (Lugana)
"This is a seriously wood-aged wine with a juicy character that comes as much from the French oak flavors as the fruit. It has weight and richness, with hints of the yellow fruits to come. The wine is ripe, full-bodied and needs to age. Drink from 2016.",Quinta da Alorna 2012 Marquesa da Alorna Reserva Branco White (Tejo)
"Viognier in Portugal brings out the grape's ripe side along with layers of rich spice. This wine is full, layered with toast and almonds as well as superripe intense fruit. Powerful, complex and dense, the wine is still very young and should be aged. Drink from 2017.",Quinta do Monte d'Oiro 2013 Madrigal Viognier (Lisboa)
"Rich and structured, this is concentrated with tannins as well as generous sweet black fruits. The tannins and the accompanying acidity mean the wine should age. Drink now, although it will be better from 2016.",Quinta do Portal 2009 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"There's a feral element to this vineyard-designate, the producer's only one from Napa Valley, from a vineyard planted originally in 1930. Extracted and thick, it offers plum, blackberry and raspberry around big, broad shoulders of mocha and oak. And as always, there's a hint of mint.",Ravenswood 2012 Dickerson Single Vineyard Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Toasty oak and black pepper hit first on the palate and nose, followed by savory, dry tannin, black cherry and vanilla. Restrained and in balance, the Cabernet is supported by 12% Petit Verdot, which adds girth and intensity without becoming extreme.",Renteria 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mount Veeder)
"Juicy, plummy and dusty, in well-integrated ways, this is a classically earthy old-vine Zin, with plush blueberry and blackberry on the palate that finishes rich in mocha and cinnamon. Medium in body and acidity, it's approachable and enjoyable now.",Seghesio 2012 Old Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"Made with Sauvignon cultivated in high mountain vineyards, this vibrant, firmly structured wine presents aromas of tropical fruit, crushed tomato vine and a whiff of hay. The linear palate offers passion fruit, alpine herb and fennel alongside brisk acidity that leaves a pristine finish.",St. Pauls 2013 Passion Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.",Doubleback 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a great Merlot that's intensely concentrated and dazzlingly rich—everything you want a Merlot to be. It's power packed with black cherries, cherry liqueur, cocoa and sweet oak, with firm, hard tannins. That is, of course, the Nickel & Nickel style. It shows classic Oakville structure and a hard-to-define elegance, making it one of the best Merlots of the vintage.",Nickel & Nickel 2010 Harris Vineyard Merlot (Oakville)
"Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec—a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aroma—a bouquet of clover and white flowers—then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis. It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.",Leonetti Cellar 2010 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",Lynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of “only the darkest, most extracted lots,” from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak. It is absolutely delicious now, but the tannin structure guarantees to develop for 10–20 years.",Von Strasser 2010 Estate Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",Von Strasser 2010 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"Black and viscous, this gorgeous Petite Sirah is intriguing in every way. Opening with aromas of just-muddled mint and freshly baked bread, this wine tastes as if wildflowers and brambly blackberry stems were placed carefully in a leather satchel. No doubt this Petite will get even more interesting with age.",Sirius 2010 Eaglepoint Ranch Petite Sirah (Mendocino County)
"This tastes like a more concentrated and sweeter version of Stottle's dry Viognier from the same vintage and vineyard. Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.",Stottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley)
"Dense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding. There is depth and power here, but it must be extracted over time and with a bit of patience.",Dr. Loosen & J. Christopher 2007 Appassionata Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Extraordinarily sweet and attractive in raspberry and cherry fruit, as concentrated and pure as anything in California. The acidity is beautiful, as you'd expect from this vineyard in such a cool vintage, and it showcases Pinot Noir's silkiness and beauty. Despite the immediate flash,  it will develop bottle complexity; hold until 2016.",Gary Farrell 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",Silverado 2009 Limited Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Capture continues to make progress in interpreting their vineyard located in this new appellation, a high elevation overlooking Alexander Valley. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8–10 years, if not longer.",Captûre 2010 Harmonie Red (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak)
"Perfumed on the nose with heady yellow florals and stonefruit, this is one stunner of a Riesling. It's powerfully concentrated on the palate with flavors of honey and sweet peach tinged with lanolin and wax. Penetrating and pure in focus, yet remarkably delicate in texture, it finishes long with layers of crushed-stone minerality.",Markus Molitor 2010 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"All Leonetti wines are 100% estate-grown fruit, mixing Seven Hills, Mill Creek Upland and Loess vineyard grapes. The 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon includes 12% Merlot, 8% Petit Verdot and 4% Carmenère in the blend. Young and chewy, with a hint of herbaceousness, this shows lovely balance and a mix of raspberry, black cherry, cassis, coffee and cacao. It's a young, deep and powerful wine that will certainly reward cellaring.",Leonetti Cellar 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Ignore its generic Oregon AVA—this is King Estate's top wine, a rich reserve-level Pinot Noir redolent with Asian spices, saffron, cumin and more. Nuances of dusty cocoa powder lead into a thrilling wine with a spine of steel, focusing its ripe, fleshy fruit through a long, cellar-worthy finish.",King Estate 2009 Domaine Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",Lynmar 2011 La Serenité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Produced from four vineyards throughout the valley, this Cabernet shows the art of the blend. It's softly tannic and frankly delicious, with dazzlingly rich blackberry, cassis liqueur, anise and mineral flavors. Hard to describe how attractive this wine is now.",Sequum 2009 Four Soil Melange Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"If there's one California Pinot Noir you cellar this vintage, make it this one. It's a stone-cold guarantee. Light and silky in the mouth, with brisk acidity, it shows rich raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors that are deep and long. Has all the necessary balance to evolve many years, and should start showing bottle development after 2018.",Calera 2010 Selleck Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan)
"This exceptional wine was made by the late David Lett to celebrate the birth of his granddaughter. It's drinking beautifully, and has the color and scent of a mature wine, though Eyrie Pinots can often live longer than those who bet against them. Delicate and subtle, it nonetheless shows surpassing power and length. Mature, fully-evolved dried fruit and herb flavors are highlighted with notes of cinnamon and brown sugar.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2000 Marguerite Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Shows the Von Strasser signature all down the line, with incredibly extracted blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and new French oak flavors, wrapped into hard tannins and brightened with fine acidity. Only the second release from this young vineyard, it's an intensely interesting, complex wine that will reward cellaring. Best after 2019.",Von Strasser 2010 Vineyard 2131 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",Lynmar 2011 Susanna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is McCrea's top cuvée, and the 2008 is as good as it has ever been. Co-fermented with 8% Viognier, it starts out tight and compact, with crisp marionberry fruit and a generous wash of coffee liqueur. The acids are citrusy and fresh, and the wine has depth and an emotional range that reaches almost symphonic power.",McCrea Cellars 2008 Cuvée Orleans Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"A delicately structured, low-alcohol Pinot from the Sonoma Coast that shows winemaker Ehren Jordan's increasing fascination with this part of Sonoma County. The wine is light in texture, with savory wild cherry, licorice, sweet tobacco, mocha, bacon and spice flavors. That sounds like a wild assortment,  but somehow it all comes together, in a wine of singular focus and discernment. Drink now–2020.",Failla 2011 Whistler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",Gary Farrell 2010 Rochioli Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",Captûre 2010 Révélation Cabernet Sauvignon (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak)
"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years.",Williams Selyem 2011 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This Cab doesn't taste especially Spring Mountain-ish. It could come from anywhere, with its jammy red cherry, mocha and oak flavors that veer into raisins. Soft and a bit hot, it provides pleasant drinking now.",Chateau Chevalier 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Red plum and scratchy, herbal aromas form a decent bouquet. This Cab is modest and edgy in feel, with equally raw and edgy red-berry flavors that finish quick and punchy.",Acordeón 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"This simple wine gets the basic Zin concept across, offering briary cherry, red currant, spice and oak flavors. It offers good value in a dry, medium-bodied wine that will drink well with a vast array of food.",Alexander Valley Vineyards 2011 Sin Zin Zinfandel (Alexander Valley)
"Firmly tannic, this is a structured wine that now lacks fruitiness. It needs to be drunk now.",Château d'Arlay 2007 Pinot Noir (Côtes du Jura)
"A smoky wine with black currant flavors that bring together spice and fruitiness. The wine has a light touch, licorice and stalky tannins ending with attractive juiciness. It is ready to drink.",DFJ Vinhos 2011 Bigode Red (Lisboa)
"With a touch of herbaceousness and a rounded texture, this is a simple and fruity wine. Light chalkiness in the texture indicates the only complexity.",Drouet Frères 2012 La Forcine  (Sancerre)
Baked strawberry and raspberry aromas carry onto the medium-bodied palate. Fine chalky tannins and bright acids lend the toasted herb flavor structural support.,Miracle Valley 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Virginia)
"The dense aromas of raisin, panettone and dark cherry are of medium intensity. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is soft and malleable, and it ends with flavors of cherry cola and dark raspberry.",Prince Michel 2009 Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"For the price, this blend of five varieties is a pretty good value. It's oaky and full-bodied in blackberries and cherries, although a streak of green unripeness runs right down the middle.",Raymond 2012 R Collection Lot No. 7 Field Blend Red (California)
"Maderized in color, this Viognier shows powdery aromas of lychee and tropical fruits. The body is round, plump and soft, while flavors of pear, almond paste, lychee and chemical turn more flat and bitter the longer this sits.",Sottano 2013 Reserva 3S Viognier (Mendoza)
"A vegetal note and excessive softness compromise this Petite Sirah. High alcohol gives it heat, while the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors are simple.",Thacher 2011 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"An earthy wine that has red berry fruits and acidity alongside a rustic barnyard character. There is a mineral edge to the wine as well, so maybe giving it a year will help.",Tiago Teles 2012 Gilda Red (Bairrada)
"Tastes like a supermarket peach, mango and pineapple fruit-juice drink, with the headiness of alcohol. There's a subtle hint of oak in this wine that finishes on the sweet side.",Tower 15 2012 Grenache Blanc (Paso Robles)
"This fruity, one-dimensional wine has flavors of blackberries, brown sugar and caramelized oak. The tannins are nice and thick, suggesting grilled meats for pairings.",Truett Hurst 2012 California Square Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"If you're new to Pinot Noir and curious, but not ready to spend a lot, check this out. It gets the idea across, with a dry, silky mouthfeel and basic flavors of raspberries, red currants and oak.",Montpellier 2012 Pinot Noir (California)
"Subdued aromas recall blue flower and berries, but overall the nose isn't very expressive. The one-dimensional palate offers red cherry but it's lean and short on freshness. This is starting to fade so drink now.",Natale Verga 2011  Chianti Classico
"An apple fresh wine, just off dry, with attractive acidity. Floral and aromatic wine, it has a crisp aftertaste.",Marquis de la Tour NV Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux)
"This is a dry style of white Port, with an aromatic character that goes through to the palate. The spirit and wine don't taste properly integrated, giving a fiery feel without much fruit. The aftertaste is bitter.",Quinta da Maritávora NV White  (Port)
"This is a light, medium sweet wine with touches of acidity to go with the fragrant pear fruits. Drink now.",Remy-Pannier 2012  Vouvray
"Sparse in flavor, this blend of Merlot, Zinfandel and Syrah is one-dimensional, soft in cranberry and slightly underripe.",Road i Red NV Red (California)
"There's big, stewy fruit happening within the midst of this soft wine. What brings it down is the finish, slightly bitter like a sour cherry.",Sobon Estate 2011 Barbera (California)
"Charred wood, espresso and thyme aromas lead onto the medium-full palate, which is supported by sturdy tannins. This Syrah would pair well with a pulled-pork hoagie.",Anemoi 2012 Lips Syrah (Grand Valley)
"This offers warm, dried-fruit aromas of prune, plum and raisin. The palate shows some subdued sour cherry and mint but it's dilute and falls apart quickly, leaving a short finish.",Colle Bereto 2011  Chianti Classico
"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with acrid aromas that recall sweat and wet leaves. The palate delivers a mouthful of raw oak, roasted coffee bean and espresso. It lacks fruit richness and finishes on a bitter note of astringent wood tannins.",Vignaioli del Morellino di Scansano 2010 Riserva Roggiano  (Morellino di Scansano)
"Citrus, tropical notes and a bit of skunky funk define the nose on this unoaked Chard. The palate is slightly metallic in feel, while the flavors suggest canned peaches and nectarine.",Zolo 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Marked by flavors of white-sugared raspberry jam and buttered cinnamon toast, this is almost a dessert wine. It will satisfy fans of sweet red wines.",Cupcake 2012 Petite Sirah (Central Coast)
"Fenestra's proprietary blend of 59% Chardonnay and 41% Sémillon, this is a wine perfumed in gardenia that has a bite of oaky barrel amid barely ripe apple that finishes quick.",Fenestra 2012 Semonnay Chardonnay-Semillon (Livermore Valley)
"This old-vine Zin has washed-out aromas and a savory, leathery character, tannic grip and a hit of smoke on the finish.",Milliaire 2010 Ghirardelli Heritage Old Vine Zinfandel (Calaveras County)
"At the start the wine shows leafy aromas and a hint of burned rubber that eventually burns off. The lean palate is evolved, and while you can still detect a note of stewed prune, most of the fruit has dried up. It ends on a bitter, drying note of astringent tannins.",Natale Verga 2010 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Fresh and balanced, this bright savory sparkler delivers mouthfuls of green apple, white peach and lemon peel. Crisp acidity keeps it refreshing while a soft mousse gives it plenty of finesse. It has a dry juicy finish.",Andreola 2016 Dirupo Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Wood aged during fermentation, this rich generous wine is the top cuvée from this major Saumur producer. It is rich with apple and citrus flavors backed by a touch of toastiness. The wine is towards dry with a touch of spice at the end. Drink this fine wine now.",Bouvet-Ladubay NV Trésor Brut  (Saumur)
"Old vines, up to 60 years old, are the basis of this concentrated, ripe and intense wine. It is impressive and tightly wound, with layers of rich citrus fruit and a chalky texture. This is still a little young, so drink from 2018.",Les Frères Couillaud 2016 Château de la Ragotière Sélection Vieilles Vignes Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"Muted aromas rise from the glass to reveal wild strawberry and floral rose notes in this wine. Crisp, underlying acidity and strong, present tannins support its ripeness and concentration, the body medium and the oak well-integrated.",Siduri 2015 Lingenfelder Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of candy corn, spice and almond butter are followed by full-bodied, tropical-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of richness and intensity. It's a delicious example of the variety, with a lingering finish.",Ashan 2016 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"One year's lees aging has softened this wine and given it great richness. It is a rounded and opulent wine, deliciously ripe and full of bold, mouth-filling fruit.",Les Frères Couillaud 2015 Château de la Ragotière Cuvée Amélie Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"One of the denomination's benchmark bottlings, this fresh yet creamy off-dry sparkler opens with alluring scents of apple, exotic fruit and white peach that carry over to the silky palate along with candied citrus zest. Crisp acidity brightens the rich flavors and creates a refreshing finish.",Nino Franco 2016 Primo Franco Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"A blend of Sangiovese (42%), Merlot (32%), and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one of the first wines coming off the estate vineyard located next to the winery. A full five years old, it's starting to show a touch of age aromatically, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, dried cherry and dried herb along with sliced green pepper. The palate shows the brightness of acidity that this region of the valley is known for, heightening the fruit flavors and stretching out the finish.",Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Cut Bank Estate Vottavo Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a great example from the warmer Bannockburn subregion of Central Otago. Dense aromas of tangy cranberries, dates, mocha and vanillan oak precede powerful but balanced tannins, lashings of acidity and a long, savory, olive-driven finish. Drink now with Moroccan cuisine or stash away through 2027.",Carrick 2013 Bannockburn Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Fresh citrus and green apple have a leafy touch and something that is reminiscent of wet stone. That taut slenderness is apparent throughout the light dry palate where lemony freshness plays the central role. The fizz is fine and creamy and leaves the mouth filled with freshness. This is vivid, has lots of verve and a clean dry finish.",Cave de Cleebourg 2014 Symphonie en P Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"There is a yeasty autolytic touch of brioche that mixes with the vivid red-apple notes of the nose which also has subtle floral overtones. The palate shows a subtle harmony of fresh tart apple, a touch of strawberry and again that tender creamy note of brioche. This lovely elegant sparkler has a very fine fizz and a very refreshing long dry finish.",Cave du Roi Dagobert NV Prestige Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted.",Clay Pigeon 2014 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (OR))
"One of the prettiest labels in Oregon adorns an equally lovely wine. It's aromatically lush with flowers, body powder and spice. The ripe berry fruit carries a dusting of cocoa powder. Drink 2018–2026.",DanCin 2015 Plié Pinot Noir (Southern Oregon)
"Smoky, earthy notes of licorice root, chicory, pepper and leather spice up the black plum, berry and cherry fruit in this blend of 42% Merlot, 21% Malbec, 16% Cabernet Franc, 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Petit Verdot. The mouthfeel is plush and filling, with generous yet structured tannins and ample acidity that frame the rich dark fruits. Final flavors of cassis and char linger long on the finish.",De Toren 2013 Z Red (Stellenbosch)
"Brambly boysenberry, blackberry liqueur and crème de cassis lead the nose and mouth of this attractive wine, with waves of cigar-box spice, mentholated herbs and leather adding intrigue. It's firmly structured and packed with black-fruit flavors, resulting in a crushed-velvet texture. The finish is long and evolving, and this should continue to develop well through 2022.",De Toren 2014 Fusion V Red (Stellenbosch)
"Though this is one of the first wines from winemaker Jennifer Hoage's own label, it's a study of soft integration from what can be a powerful site. Cherry, allspice and rose aromas lead into a palate full of wild berry and hearty sagebrush notes, framed by pitch-perfect acidity. A light yet spicy licorice-inflected finish completes the experience.",Decroux 2015 Radian Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"An unusually fresh herbal note of lemon balm hovers on the nose. The palate, however, counters this with ample honeyed sweetness. The lemon-balm note flashes here and there and the residual sugar frames notions of ripe Mirabelle plum beautifully. This will work well as a counterpoint to sharp blue cheeses with its medium-sweet finish.",Domaine Fernand Engel 2015 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Enticing aromas of chocolate-cherry cake blend seamlessly with meat, earth and baking spices. The tannins are chewy but fine grained and beautifully balanced. Tart cherries and savory olive linger on the finish. Drink now–2024.",Forrest 2013 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"From one of Marlborough's top producers, Framingham's 2015 Pinot offers a heady concoction of dark berry fruit, cola, meat, black olive and earthy forrest floor.

Tender notes of lemon on the nose segue into riper citrus notes on the palate. This is a taut but textured wines which has a concentrated palate with an almost oily feel.

"Enticing scents of honeysuckle, jasmine and orchard fruit mingle together while the bone-dry savory palate offers apple, pear and tangerine. An elegant perlage and vibrant acidity lend finesse and freshness while a hint of thyme closes the crisp finish.",La Tordera 2016 Oltreval Rive di Guia Zero  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"With an attractive toasty aroma, this wine is rich and delicious. It is one of this producer's nonvintage blends, a very superior marriage between Grand Cru grapes from the Côte des Blancs and Montagne de Reims. With apple, toast and lemon flavors it is dry and ready to drink.",Lombard et Cie NV Brut Nature Grand Cru  (Champagne)
"Another clean and tasty bottling from this label's numbered series, this shows light nectarine and lemon aromas on the nose.

"Austere and severe, this single-vineyard wine is very much a product of its limestone terroir. It has a mineral intensity that pushes through the tannins and black currant fruit, giving a powerful, dark character. Firm and structured, this is a wine for the long term.",Les Astéries 2010  Saint-Émilion
"The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch.",Stone The Crows 2010 Three Twins Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Equal parts Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this is a powerfully rich wine based on the 1998 and 1997 vintage. It is full, packed with citrus, peach and apricot flavors mingling with a beautiful, generous creamy texture. This is a glorious Champagne, a worthy homage to Louis Tarlant who pioneered the family's Champagne in the early 20th century.",Tarlant NV Hommage à Louis Tarlant Brut  (Champagne)
"Here's a beautiful interpretation from the 2008 vintage that shows balance, harmony and intensity all zipped up into one tight package. That seamless integration, followed by rich extraction, gives the wine momentum overall. Although this is a different wine from past vintages, the quality is just as high. Hold 5–10 years.",Uccelliera 2008  Brunello di Montalcino
"Using Grenache sourced from the moderately cool Lonesome Springs Vineyard, this is slightly leafy, with notes of forest floor, blueberry and blackberry. This is the first pure Grenache ever made by Brian Carter. It doesn't just taste like a big bowl of berries; it has power and depth to spare.",Brian Carter Cellars 2010 1 Grenache (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Beautifully aged, this shows a dusty, ripe quality. The bouquet is rounded out by notes of leather, resin, molasses, tobacco, dried ginger, cola and licorice. There's a tight firmness to the tannins, which have gracefully carried this wine forward over the years.",Villa Spinosa 2001 Guglielmi di Jago  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"With that extra concentration that comes from low-yielding old vines, this has great depth of flavor. It has an apple flavor and crisp, citrusy acidity as well as a more toasty character. Complex and certainly ageworthy, this should keep for at least five years.",Pascal Bouchard 2010 Les Vieilles Vignes Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"Much of the fruit for this wine comes from Napa's Mount Veeder, with additions from neighboring Sonoma County and other unidentified statewide sources. Even so, this shows a Napa-esque flair, bearing softly ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, with balance and richness. The winemakers and owners are the husband and wife team from Mount Veeder's Lagier-Meredith.",Punch 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Though quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009.",Sleight of Hand 2010 Levitation Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style.",Sleight of Hand 2010 The Enchantress Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"Sourced from a small vineyard in the The Rocks of Walla Walla, this shows classic, terroir-driven umami flavors. It's as if the fruit were soaked in seaweed, then lifted on a platform of rock. It has lovely aromatics, with a rather delicate finish that's nuanced with cherry and tar.",Sleight of Hand 2010 The Funkadelic Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is big in fruit, big in tannins and big in the overall impression it leaves. It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H. Smith Winery, whose Pinot Noirs were magnificent and scored highly. This one seems a little heavier than Smith used to produce.",Del Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Deliciously perfumed, this shows some of the structure of the vintage, along with generous raspberry and red cherry flavors. It is rich and solid, and its open character has just the right edge of dense tannins. Already approachable, but it's likely to age over several years.",Domaine Heresztyn 2010 Les Millandes Premier Cru  (Morey-Saint-Denis)
"Firm, concentrated and solid, this has a tight core that's surrounded by sweeter dark-plum fruit. This is ripe and full bodied, with a definite need for aging.",Domaine Vincent Girardin 2010 Santenots Premier Cru  (Volnay)
"This shows the textural depth of all the Efesté wines. A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish. It has great power and flavor, with the possibility of cellaring for a decade or more.",Efeste 2009 Final-Final Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Mostly Syrah, with some Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a succulent rosé with a marvelous mouthfeel. Texture and length are its main charms, with nuanced notes of rose petal, hibiscus, watermelon and pie cherry. The vineyard sources are Klipsun, Boushey and Ciel du Cheval.",Efeste 2011 Babbitt Rosé (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Big and bold, this has noticeable alcohol and loads of chocolate, espresso and jammy black-fruit flavors. The overall muscle and brawn of the mouthfeel give balance to the heat and intensity. Pair this with aged cheese or grilled steak.",Fabiano 2005 I Fondatori Riserva  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"After a waxy opening, the bouquet unveils honey and peach aromas that are totally inviting. It feels thick but not cloying, and the honeyed flavors of banana, peach and dulce de leche are a prelude to the creamy, thick and deeply layered finish. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Albariño make the blend.",D.G. Viticultors NV Caligo Sweet White Wine White (Spain)
"Gorgeously aromatic with notes of freshly pressed apple, wildflower honey and tangerine peel, this is a richly textured, almost creamy, ice wine. Intense flavors of honey and fresh apple ripple on the palate, with striking lemon acidity that lends a squeaky clean finish.",Inniskillin 2008 Ice Wine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
"This delivers about the same intensity and concentration as a top shelf Amarone—but for half the price. It offers loads of spice, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and black olive flavors that drive the long, supple mouthfeel.",Le Salette 2009 I Progni  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso)
"Still tight and chewy, this lushly-fruited Syrah mixes berry and cherry flavors with earthier, mineral-driven bass notes. It will require a bit more bottle age to unwind and decompress, but it has all of the ingredients of a wine with staying power.",Mark Ryan 2009 Wild Eyed Syrah (Red Mountain)
"This is very structured and full, with a powerful minerality, citrus and spice flavors, and a tight, nervy character. It has the weight to age for 3–4 years.",Joseph Drouhin 2010  Chassagne-Montrachet
"This doles out multiple layers of cinnamon, red cherry, vanilla, blackberry, espresso and tobacco flavors. It's modern, chewy and bright, with slightly sweet flavors that would pair with pork and roasted fennel or steak with a creamy mushroom sauce.",Latium di Morini 2008 Campo Leòn  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"Big and fruity, this is very lively, balancing butteriness with green-fruit acidity. The wine is maturing quickly, its tension is fading into rich, wood-flavored fruitiness.",Louis Latour 2010 Meursault Blagny Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"While it's not for everyone, this is a great expression of Rosenblum-style Rockpile Zin. It's a big, lusty glass of red wine, warm and heady, with extraordinarily ripe berry, currant and mocha flavors.",Rosenblum 2010 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"Powerful and muscular, this would pair with succulent red meat or piquant cheese. The mouthfeel is velvety and supple, and the bouquet is redolent of cooked berry, prune, dried bay leaf, humus, toasted coffee bean and licorice.",Rubinelli Vajol 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"This mixes blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry notes with a dressing of Bourbon and chocolate. Smooth and satiny, this is drinking exceptionally well at the moment.",Sleight of Hand 2009 Levitation Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit.",Soos Creek 2009 Sundance Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A blend of mainly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other traditional Bordeaux varieties, this treads perilously close to being too ripe. It shows a hint of raisin, but not enough to interfere with the beauty of the blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. The tannins are exquisite, in the way of a top Napa Cab. Doesn't seem to be a longterm ager, so drink now–2015.",Alpha Omega 2009 Proprietary Red (Napa Valley)
"Using grapes sourced entirely from Boushey Vineyard, this well-structured Syrah has a claret-like refinement. Sleek and focused, it offers raspberry and black cherry flavors, with a tight, taut structure and length. Some notes of leaf and earth trickle onto the finish.",Avennia 2010 Arnaut Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"The minerality is a reminder that the grapes come from an area near Chablis. It has a tangy, zingy character, with a nervy edge that promises aging, but it also provides fruity, apple-driven pleasure now.",Bailly-Lapierre 2007 Vive-la-Joie Brut  (Crémant de Bourgogne)
"Dark and brawny, this opens with almost impenetrable concentration and bold aromas of jammy fruit, blackberry, espresso, cedar and moist tobacco. It has a smooth, rich texture, with lively highlights of teriyaki, ginger and cola.",Brunelli 2009  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"From the prestigious Rutherford appellation comes this soft, smooth and mellow Cabernet, with delicious flavors of black cherry, cola and beef teriyaki. It shows just a trace of bitterness on the finish, so drink soon.",Del Bondio 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This is a soft, bland wine, with light fruit flavors, a creamy texture and a final tang of lemon zest. Drink now.",Parras Wines 2014 Terra Grande Branco White (Alentejano)
"This wine has too much wood, with high toast and spice. The fruit is dominated by this wood that is not likely to soften.",Lavradores de Feitoria 2014 Meruge Red (Douro)
"Aromas of oak and orange peel include a strong whiff of clove. This is creamy and resiny in feel, while oaky flavors—clove in particular—sit on top of red-fruit notes. Dry barrel-related flavors are hot on the finish.",Altocedro 2015 Año Cero Pinot Noir (La Consulta)
"A cuvée of Riesling, with a tiny splash of Moscato, this is on the sweet side of brut. Scents of wet paper carry into disjointed flavors of waxy lemon and simple sugar.",Wetzel Estate NV Cuvée Blanc Sparkling (Willamette Valley)
"This extremely simple red has aromas recalling dark-skinned fruit and leather. The lean diluted palate shows suggestions of sour cherry, dried plum and a hint of dark spice alongside fleeting tannins.",Montefrasco 2015 Montefresco  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"A gluey aroma follows through, cloaking simple, sour flavors of lemon tea in its wake. There is an off flavor in the finish that doesn't subside.",Château Bianca 2015 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
This wine has a geranium aroma and a strangely perfumed character. It is light and fruity although not likely to develop much.,Quinta do Romeu 2011 Red (Douro)
"This wine of unknown grape varieties shows a thread of sweet cola and vanilla throughout a larger tunnel of smoky char, remaining somewhat flat, bitter and simple on the palate.",Sonoma Collection 2014 District 3 Red (Sonoma County)
"Charred, malty, foxy, herbal aromas sound the alarm. This Garnacha-Carignan blend is rough as sandpaper, with heavily oaked flavors of herbaceous black fruits. A rough and rugged finish is abrasive.",Zerran 2014 Red (Montsant)
"This dull, tired wine is quickly moving past drinkability. Flat and lifeless, it hints at leather and little else.",Wetzel Estate 2012 Estate Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Syrupy and with a distinct taste of raisins, this 100% varietal wine is overdone in terms of ripeness, with a lack of structure. The highlight is its tight hold on black pepper.",Meeker 2012 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Chunky pithy stone-fruit and citrus aromas are sketchy, while the palate is tangy and none too pleasant. Flavors of mealy citrus fruits and a finish with the consistency of orange juice do nothing to help this along.",Altos de Cristimil 2015 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Wiry and volatile aromas of vinegar and saucy berry fruits fail to impress. This Monastrell-Tempranillo blend is hard and tannic, with murky berry flavors that are also a bit weedy. Heat and a lack of ripeness mar the finish.",Marques Escriba 2013 Monastrell-Tempranillo Red (Jumilla)
"Berry and lemon-peel aromas come with a note of plastic. This feels narrow and acidic, and thus scraping. Tart plum and spice flavors lead to an herbal high-acid palate that leaves a sour lasting impression.",Casa Montes 2014 Ampakama Cabernet Sauvignon (San Juan)
"It's not possible to analyze vineyard practices from afar, but this wine is thin, tart and astringent, suggesting such possibilities as over-cropping, picking too early, or simply the wrong clones. In any event, it's a flavorless wine with no varietal character.",Del Rio 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rogue Valley)
"The aromas show notes of game, vanilla and grape Jolly Rancher, with the volatiles amped up. The flavors bring a mixture of sweet and tart, tussling through the finish.",Oak Knoll NV Toasted Cow 5th Edition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Dusty apple aromas set up a foamy palate with no depth or structure. This tastes of bready apple and pear in front of a bland, yeasty finish that nose dives at the count of three.",Bodegas Lozano NV Ophicus Brut Cuvée Sparkling (Spain)
"Aromas of game, cured meat, mature violet and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. It's extremely simple and diluted, with fleeting tannins and brisk acidity. Tried two bottles, same notes.",Il Chiosso 2008  Ghemme
"The 2013 vintage may not have been good in Spain, but this is really struggling. Green aromas are sharp and suggest vinegar. This feels hard as a pile of rocks, with herbal flavors of green tomato and rustic plum. An herbal-tasting astringent finish will win no new friends.",Marqués de Vargas 2013 Conde de San Cristóbal  (Ribera del Duero)
"Diluted and lean, this opens with aromas recalling wet soil and cut flowers past their prime. The thin über-simple palate isn't very expressive, showing mere suggestions of dried sour cherry and an earthy note.",Pigro 2014  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo
"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are probing and raw. This feels acidic to the point of cutting. Sour, salty, herbal red-fruit flavors are gritty and rough on the finish. This is Salta Cabernet in its most raw, least appealing form.",Quara 2015 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Cafayate)
"This wine is woody, showing concentrated toast and vanilla flavors. It seems to be missing its fruit.",Roncão 2012 Quinta da Levandeira Reserva Red (Douro)
"This dilute red wine could be anything. It's green, tannic, and generic.",Del Rio 2013 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
This wine is perfumed with geranium aromas and rhubarb flavors. It is strange and not likely to improve.,Quinta do Romeu 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)
"Earthy aromas of animal and stewed black fruits set up a hot palate with oaky mint and clove flavors. This is gripping and warm on the finish, with an excess of oak and hard tannins.",Haarth 2013 Made With Organic Grapes Bonarda (Argentina)
"This brut sparkler is out there on the nose, as earthy, not-too-fresh aromas of peanuts and compost set up a coarse palate. Nutty stale citrus flavors end in sour fashion, with a hint of mustard.",Hacienda del Carche NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)
"Light in color, sketchy on the nose and dilute on the palate, all of which means this has discernible issues. Bland flavors suggest grape skins, while this is flat, wheaty and yeasty tasting on the finish.",Trencalòs 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Hot rubbery untamed aromas need help. This Syrah-led blend feels clampy and rough. Salty murky black-fruit flavors are herbal and wild, and there's no help coming on the finish, which is grabby.",Josep Grau Viticultor 2015 L'Efecte Volador Red (Montsant)
"The intent here seems to be a low-alcohol “pure” expression of Bonarda. But with volatile high-toned cherry and raspberry aromas along with a narrow scouring palate, this comes across as tart and lean. Sour herbal red-plum flavors are raw on the finish.",Via Revolucionaria 2015 Pura Bonarda (Mendoza)
"Oxidized apricot aromas comprise the bulk of the nose on this weird oak-aged Albariño. Flavors of apricot, peach pit and quince quickly turn bitter, while the finish is flabby. Overall this is sketchy, with few attributes.",Altos de Torona 2013 Barrica Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Open and simple, this has a light touch of citrus fruit, with an edge of wood in the background. It is bright and ready to drink.",Domaine Patrick Javillier 2010 Cuvée Oligocene  (Bourgogne)
"There's virtually no bouquet to this wine, and the palate follows suit with a flat feel and hollow, faded flavors of balsamic-doused cherry and herb. It seems aged and dried out.",Finca Vieja 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"This Cabernet was made to be consumed as a dessert wine. It's soft, simple and very sweet, with white sugar and cherry jam flavors.",Jeunesse 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Fruity, ripe and round, this is simple Chardonnay that gives pleasure from its warm texture and softness. The apple flavor leads to a gentle finish.",Lupé-Cholet 2010  Bourgogne
"A blend of 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot, this feels a little light on flesh, providing little cushion to the high acids. A campfire smokiness underscores the rusty dark-fruit note, which ultimately finishes a bit short.",2 Lads 2009 Cabernet Franc-Merlot (Old Mission Peninsula)
"A hit of sulfur slowly blows off to reveal aromas of hot stone and maple syrup, with undertones of dark stone fruit and dill. The medium-bodied palate offers soft acids that lend a slightly flat feel, with mild tannins adding some support.",Brys 2010 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Old Mission Peninsula)
"Hints of chalk dust and savory stem and leaf notes detract from the bright peach, grapefruit and flower notes on both the nose and palate. Dry in style, but its a shade sugary on the attack.",Silver Thread 2011 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes)
"Notes of spiced toast, Raisinets, hickory and prune mingle on the smoky, slightly baked nose. The flavors are concentrated and intense, but the baked quality is a little too distracting.",Mount Pleasant Winery 2007 Bethlehem Valley Norton (Missouri)
"A dirty nose spoils this otherwise attractive, easy, crisp Chablis. The palate has some notes of yeast and bright white fruit, with a citrusy finish.",Domaine L. Chatelain 2011  Chablis
"This is a lean, acid-driven wine, without much in the way of generous fruit. It has a green strawberry note, with a light sense of structure and a minerally finish.",L. Tramier & Fils 2010 La Minée  (Bourgogne)
"This is a gentle wine that's textured with acidity, offering yellow and white fruits and some toast and spice flavors. It is round and soft, finishing with a tight edge of acidity.",Louis Jadot 2010  Bourgogne
"Surprisingly light for the vintage, this has a wood note and intense acidity, with a crisp, almost green, raspberry flavor. The finish is juicy.",André Guichot 2009  Bourgogne
"The spiced dark-cherry and blackberry aromas come with a rusty edge, leading to a palate that's marked by vivid acids and trifling tannic support. In general, this is lithe and easy, a wine that would pair well with pizza.",Vivác Winery 2009 Montepulciano (New Mexico)
"Stewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate. Flavors of stewed berry, spiced tomato and burnt leaves turn slightly bitter on what amounts to a short finish.",Gladium 2009 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"Flavors of berry preserves and toast are loosely concentrated, with peppy acids that charge the palate. It finishes rather short on flavor; the tannic grip is the lasting element.",Mount Pleasant Winery NV Dry Norton (Missouri)
"This has a prevailing fortified-wine scent to its nose, with details of plum liqueur and mint-chocolate. It's muscular and overtly firm on the palate; the fortified wine quality creates a slightly discordant sensation.",Mount Pleasant Winery NV Estates Cabernet Sauvignon (America)
"Smelling grapey on the nose, this has additional notes of white currant, toast and white stone fruit. It starts soft, with flavors that are rather low in concentration. The medium-bodied mouthfeel turns zesty as the wine advances across the palate, finishing with touches of honeyed toast and apple.",Three Fox 2010 La Boheme Viognier (Virginia)
"The acidity is the prominent attribute of this wine, jutting out with little flesh to buffer its cut. Light, dusty tannins add some traction to the palate, with a leafy herb note surfacing on the short finish.",Truro 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Southeastern New England)
"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors. The finish is cleansing, but it doesn't show much substance.",Santa Quiteria 2010 Altitud 1.100 Garnacha Tintorera Alicante Bouschet (Almansa)
"A jammy raspberry aroma comes with milk chocolate and plastic scents. It feels pulpy yet spunky, with red plum and strawberry flavors. The mild finish doesn't evolve or expand, but it registers as being fresh.",Bodegas Navarro López 2009 Old Vines Crianza Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"This smells like a melted Luden's cough drop sprinkled with coffee grounds and spices. Medium bodied, it has a jumbled herbal flavor, finishing with warmth and notes of dark chocolate and coffee.",Vivác Winery 2009 Tempranillo (New Mexico)
"This Cabernet has blackberry and dried herb flavors, with sizable tannins and pretty hefty acidity.",Wine Spots 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"There's a raw cut of acidity that gives this simple wine a sour taste. On the plus side, it's nice and dry, with some cherry fruit. For the price, it's a helpful introduction to the charms of Pinot Noir.",Lost Angel 2011 Pinot Noir (California)
"This blend of 75% Pinot Grigio and 15% Vermentino is a light, simple quaff with some snap to it and not much on the finish.",Peltier 2011 Hybrid Pinot Grigio (Lodi)

"Light and simple, this is all about fruit and freshness. There is a hint of citrus, and the acidity shows well on the finish. More of an aperitif style.",Pierre André 2010 Octavie Crémieux  (Bourgogne)
"This is a combination of tropical fruits and tight acidity, making for an unbalanced wine that seems not to know its way.",Domaine Verret et Fils 2010  Chablis
"This is very soft and lacking in definition, with a light texture. However, it does have a crisp apple flavor and a line of acidity that gives freshness.",Georges Duboeuf 2011  Mâcon-Villages
"Chewy tannins and tart acids buttress the midpalate's broad berry flavor. The fruit seems to thin out on the finish, concluding with more bone and muscle than succulent flesh. Pairing this with a rare burger would help tame the structural components.",Debonné 2009 Cabernet Franc (Grand River Valley)
"Generous floral and honeylike aromas lead to flavors of Fuji apples and Anjou pears with a rounded, fairly crisp texture. This wine is not typical for the varietal, but is tasty and enjoyable.",Middle Sister NV Surfer Chick Sauvignon Blanc (California)

"Grass, herb and passion-fruit aromas are followed by citrus and tropical flavors. It's pleasant but the concentration seems lacking.",14 Hands 2014 The Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Horse Heaven Hills)

"Earthy, scratchy berry, plum and spice aromas are inviting on the nose. This is bold, acidic and a touch sharp in feel, with generic black-fruit flavors as well as toasty oak and spice. A fresh finish with leftover notes of blackberry winds things down.",Viña La Fortuna 2013 Ventura Reserve Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"This Malbec opens with a blast of raw woodgrain, a lactic smell, leather and finally some black fruit. The palate is racy and potent, with resiny oak leading herbal berry flavors. A fiery, hot finish brings this to a scouring close.",Vistamar 2013 Sepia Reserva Malbec (Maule Valley)
"With saucy, herbal, briny aromas and a short, limited but fresh palate, this qualifies as a light, cool-climate Pinot Noir. Salty, briny red-plum flavors finish with citric tang and a note of sea foam.",Vistamar 2014 Reserva Sepia Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Latex and spice aromas accent raw red-fruit scents of plum and currant. This feels citric, tangy and lean, with dry, spicy, lightly oaked red-plum and cherry pie flavors.

"Yeasty aromas lead to a mild palate with a modest bubble bead. In fact, this is so smooth and low on edge that it comes across more like a still rosé than sparkling rosé. Flavors of peach and nectarine finish round, pithy and yeasty.",Indomita NV Rosé Sparkling (Casablanca Valley)

"Bell pepper and citrus aromas are limited in scope. The palate feels acidic, with quick-hitting flavors of green herbs, bell pepper and tropical fruits. Pyrazine-based flavors of bell pepper and bitter herbs push the finish.",Millaman 2014 Estate Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)
"This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.",La Chablisienne 2006 Les Preuses Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.",Lookout Ridge 2006 Greg La Follette Van de Kamp Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)
"This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",Olivier Leflaive 2006  Corton-Charlemagne
"Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2–3 years.",Xavier Monnot 2006 Les Charmes Premier Cru  (Meursault)
"A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors—dried apricot, mango and lemon—in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.",Domaine Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"Bold and forward, this estate-grown Syrah fairly explodes with scents of game, cured meat and smoke. The black cherry and cassis fruit forms a dense and sappy core; as the wine skips across the tongue nuances of tobacco, sweet leather, chocolate and spices come into play. It just keeps on going, adding caramel and peppery chocolate through an evolving and satisfying finish.",Fielding Hills 2006 RiverBend Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope)
"This exuberant Tokaji starts with an enticing nose of orange peel, honey, flowers and toast, and explodes in the mouth with intense, delicious waves of lemon, orange and honey flavors. A perfect balance of acid and fruit keeps the wine fresh without losing its luscious appeal. A memorable wine loaded with personality and excitement.",Royal Tokaji 1999 Mézes Mály Aszú 6 Puttonyos  (Tokaji)
"A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.",Domaine Laroche 2006 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"A superb wine. It opens slowly in the mouth, revealing layers of toast followed by intense white and green fruits. Spice and nutmeg accent the kiwi, pepper and pineapple notes, all concentrated around a core of minerality. Age for at least four years.",Domaine Leflaive 2006 Clavoillon Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",Sheridan Vineyard 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.",Whitehall Lane 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.",Woodward Canyon 2006 Old Vines Dedication Series #26 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.",Dutton-Goldfield 2006 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",Chanson Père et Fils 2005 Champs Gains Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"A beautiful Pinot Noir notable for sheer lusciousness, which is partly due to high alcohol. The flavors are remarkably rich and ripe in cherries, currants and cola, with savory hints of mint and cocoa. Displays a great balance of acids, tannins and oak. Great now and for a decade.",Joseph Swan Vineyards 2006 Great Oak Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness. Packed with dry berry, cherry, leather, mocha and toasty oak flavors, it's beautiful now, with decanting, and should hold and even improve for up to six years.",Lost Canyon 2007 Trenton Station Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"Stillwater and Conner Lee vineyard grapes go into this fresh and spicy Chardonnay, detailed with herb and spice and cucumber flavors. An interesting take on Washington Chardonnay, with unusual complexity and length. The spicy notes extend beautifully; though known primarily as a red wine producer, Mark Ryan has an especially good feel for white wines.",Mark Ryan 2006 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A wine that shows the superlative quality of white Burgundy in 2006, this is big, powerful and yet finely restrained. The yellow fruits are tempered with citrus, the weight and full character of the wine balanced with ultra-fresh acidity. Age this wine for 2–3 years.",Olivier Leflaive 2006 Les Pucelles Premier Cru  (Puligny-Montrachet)
"Here's one for the cellar. The tannins swamp the mouth, giving a hard, astringent edge. But the wine is beautifully balanced and dry, with a deep core of black currants, blueberries, spicy plums, cedar and minerals. Impressive. Best after 2010.",Roberts & Rogers 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Very black and dense, a super-young wine that shows pedigree and promise for development. Impresses for its fine structure of thick tannins and acidity, and the way the lush black currant and chocolate fruit meets the toasty oak. Good now, and should improve for up to four or five years, at least.",Quivet Cellars 2006 Las Madres Vineyard Syrah (Carneros)
"This wine has a rustic but appealing air about it, with its cedary pepper and luscious jam nose and elegant balance of berry, smoke and spice. The wine is approachable and will pair with smoked meats and spicy dishes well.",The Foundry 2004 Syrah (Coastal Region)
"Tight mineral notes shape this wine and created extra dimension over what is a simple, genuine and fruity Chianti Classico. The wine offers chewy cherry, some chocolate notes and spicy acidity on the close.",Villa Cerna 2006  Chianti Classico
"Although this Pinot is a bit thin, it does offer plenty of elegant sophistication. The structure shows off the Sonoma Coast, with vibrant acidity and a clean, dry mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherries with bitter skins, pomegranates, rhubarb, cola and peppery spices. Drink now.",Williams Selyem 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"The wine opens with sweet aromas of bursting cherry, marzipan, cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of licorice for extra dimension. It offers some sour cherry in the mouth with spicy tones over a lean, streamlined consistency. Made by enologist Stefano Chioccioli.",Gagliole 2006 Rubiolo  (Chianti Classico)
"A wine that's all about grapefruit and white currant fruits. This is very fresh, very crisp, tightened by minerality, with a lively, juicy lemon finish.",Guilbaud Frères 2007 Le Soleil Nantais  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This nice drinking Chard offers plenty of bang for the buck. It's dry and creamy, with oak-infused pear, peach and green apple fruit flavors that finish in a swirl of dusty spices.",Cameron Hughes 2006 Lot 59 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This is a smooth and creamy Vernaccia with loads of honey backed by delicate nuances of stone fruit and passion fruit. It leaves a light, crisp impression in the mouth and can be paired with appetizers or pasta dishes.",Casa alle Vacche 2007  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"This wine delivers notes of forest floor and small berries  backed by clove, green spice, pretty herbal and menthol notes. It's a bit raw and thorny in the mouth but it does offer refreshing crispness and sweet fruit on the finish.",Castello Vicchiomaggio 2006 Montevasco  (Chianti Classico)
"Tastes a bit old and tired for a Zin that's less than 4 years of age, but on the plus side is the light, silky texture and complex flavors of dried berries and red currants, cola, cocoa, anise and black peppercorn.",D'Argenzio 2004 Tom Feeney Ranch Old Vine Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"Very fresh, crisp raspberry flavors are layered with acidity. This shows the bright red fruit character of 2007—light, fragrant, maybe finishing with some leanness.",Domaine du Clos du Fief 2007 Cuvée Tradition  (Juliénas)
"An intense, dark-colored wine, flavored with spice, tobacco, hints of mint and dark berry fruits. It's certainly rich, but the tannins do come through along with some green pepper flavors to finish.",Domaine Philippe Delesvaux 2005 La Montée de l'Epine Cabernet Sauvignon (Anjou)
"Soft and fruity, showing attractive ripe red cherry fruits along with hints of candy, light acidity and gentle tannins. It's a pleasing wine, easy and ready to drink, one of those Beaujolais that is best slightly chilled.",Georges Duboeuf 2007  Beaujolais-Villages
"This is crystalline Vernaccia with bright aromas of pear, citrus and a touch of white peppercorn or natural rubber. It goes down in a fresh and clean manner and ends with a citrus crispness.",Vagnoni 2007  Vernaccia di San Gimignano
"Oaky and a little spotty, with aromas of cheese, cinnamon and wood resin sitting heavily on herbal, traditional fruit. The acidity is bracing, so there's a lemony bite to the palate along with flavors of raisin, raspberry and cherry. A fairly good blend of Merlot, Carmenère and Cabernet, but one that's missing a few parts.",Valle Frio 2004 Reserva Merlot-Carmenère-Cabernet Sauvignon Red (Maule Valley)
"This is an easy, fruit-forward wine that would pair well with family dinners and simple pasta dishes. Cherry, bramble, wet earth, pressed violets and light coffee tones characterize the nose and are exactly what you should look for in a no-fuss Chianti. Vibrant berry flavors are carried forward thanks to the wine's smooth structure.",Villa Poggio Salvi 2006 Caspagnolo  (Chianti Colli Senesi)
"Pale in color and tart in acidity, this Pinot is a bit on the thin side, fruit-wise. It offers a blast of Asian spices and mint, with suggestions of cherries, citrus zest and Dr. Pepper. Drink this dry, elegant wine now.",Williams Selyem 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Light peach aromas mix with a hint of sea breeze to give this wine a subtle approach. The palate is more alive, with mild citrus and lemon-lime flavors. Almost seems like a refreshing sip of lemonade by the time it fades away.",La Playa 2007 Block Selection Limari Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley)
"Luminous and bright, this beautiful Vernaccia offers pretty tones of honey, peach, pear and cherry blossoms. There's a sweet element to the nose that creates an interesting contrast with the wine's natural acidity.",Le Solive 2007 Vigna Aprico  (Vernaccia di San Gimignano)
"On the leaner side, with mineral overtones to the grapefruit and cut-grass aromas and flavors. Comes out of the bottle with some smelly reductive notes that take some aeration to eliminate, so decant before serving.",Mount Nelson 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"A crisp, delicious wine, with all the right fresh acidity, tensely green fruits and very refreshing lightness. The wine will sit delicately and satisfyingly alongside any fish dish.",Remy-Pannier 2007  Muscadet Sèvre et Maine
"No question this is a taut, crisp, mineral, smoky Sauvignon Blanc from the grape's heartland. It has plenty of herbaceous edges, but the core is ripe, tropical and juicy.",Remy-Pannier 2007  Sancerre
"Robertson has managed to create a solid, appealing Chardonnay at an excellent price. This one has a big nose of fresh fruit and orange citrus, and on the palate, assertive fruit and toast. Not terribly complex but definitely robust and flavorful, this is an ideal everyday white.",Robertson Winery 2007 Chardonnay (Robertson)
"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",Sbragia 2006 Home Ranch Chardonnay (Dry Creek Valley)
"Shows those classic, old-fashioned Howell Mountain tannins that lock the wine down and make it more or less undrinkable in youth. There are some good black currant flavors, but they're not really powerful, and have herbal notes alongside. That makes the future of this wine a question.",Serdonis 2004 Ink Grade Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)
"Pungent grassy aromas vie with passion fruit on the nose, while the flavors lean more toward the tropical fruit side of things. This is a medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc that plays it safe, offering a comfortable drink at a reasonable price.",Seven Terraces 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"This overall good, refreshing Chard is a go-to white for everyday sipping. On the nose, citrus, apples, and fresh Chardonnay fruit leads, and on the palate, straightforward fruit is both elegant and approachable. The finish is substantial. Pair with poultry, seafood, or sip alone.",Shark Trust 2007 Great White Unwooded Chardonnay (Western Cape)
Here's a fresh and feminine expression of Pinot Nero with nuances of wild berry and white cherry followed by light touches of spice and almond skin. Balanced acidity and a lively finish make the wine very enjoyable indeed.,Kellerei Kaltern Caldaro 2010 Pinot Nero (Alto Adige)
"A brisk, sturdy Cabernet, marked by firm tannins, tart acidity and a marked coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's Janzen's basic Napa Cabernet, and shows the winery's ability to produce elegant Cabs. But it's not an ager.",Janzen 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A rich and fruity wine with dense cherry and strawberry fruits and a dry, tannic structure. It has a tough edge that suggests aging potential while also bringing out a ripe character from this southernmost appellation in the Côte d'Or.",Jean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2010 Clos Roussots Premier Cru  (Maranges)
"K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value. It's elegant in construction, with tailored tannins and acids and fine flavors of blackberries and currants that lead to a spicy finish.",Kendall-Jackson 2011 Vintner's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"All from Windrige Vineyard, this is an aromatic, appealing dessert-style wine with notes of dried pink grapefruit and honey. At 18.6% residual sugar, it's rich and concentrated, with good depth and intensity.",Koenig Vineyards 2010 Ice Wine Riesling
"This feminine Prosecco Superiore offers bright floral notes of jasmine and honeysuckle followed by peach and melon. The style is extra dry, meaning there is a veil of sweetness at the back, that is enhanced by the soft sparkling foam. This wine is truly enjoyable.",La Tordera NV Serrai Extra Dry  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"A lovely rosé, dry and crisp, with peach skin, orange, strawberry and white pepper flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity. Would score higher if not for a certain heaviness.",Le P'tit Paysan 2011 Pierre's Pirouette Rosé of Mourvèdre (San Benito County)

"Pfendler has striven to raise the quality of their Pinot Noir, and this 2011 keeps them firmly in place. It's a good, sound wine, dry and silky, with bright acidity and fine raspberry and cherry flavors.",Pfendler 2011 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This blend of Vermentino (70%), Fiano, Incrocio Manzoni, Verdicchio and Petit Manseng opens with generous tones of peach, apricot, lemon curd and soft almond paste. The wine is creamy and silky on the long finish.",Podere Guado al Melo 2010 Guado al Melo White (Toscana)
"There's a dark and austere quality to this Chianti Classico riserva that gives it a very masculine personality. When aged, Sangiovese tends to deliver aromas of candied fruit, cassis, tar and licorice, and this wine does just that.",Querciavalle 2007 Losi Millennium Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"The aromas are light for a Viognier, with notes of flowers, herbs and peach. Still, it brings a lot of appeal, with broad fruit flavors accented by residual sugar (0.4%), showing a bit of heat on the finish.",Season 2012 Viognier (Southern Oregon)
"New Zealand-like in style, with brisk acidity highlighting gooseberry, spearmint and Meyer lemon flavors. Elegant and clean for drinking now, especially with Asian fare.",Stonestreet 2011 Aurora Point Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)

"This is a fine Merlot, that's dry, supple and highly drinkable. It has some complex flavors of cherries, currants and smoky oak, and the alcohol is refreshingly moderate. Ready to drink now.",Storyteller 2011 Once Upon a Dream Merlot (Sonoma County)
Suavia is one of the best producers of Soave wine. This expression shows beautiful fullness in the mouth with a bright citrus finished backed by endnotes of melon and peach.,Suavia 2010 Monte Carbonare  (Soave Classico)
"Heady in alcohol and dense in tannins, this Syrah has a mouth-filling richness of blackberry jam, plums, dark chocolate and pepper. It's absolutely delicious. A bit too soft for aging, so drink up.",Sutcliffe 2010 Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
"A savory Pinot Gris that shows how well the variety can grow in Carneros. It was barrel fermented, which gives a creamy richness to the citrus and tropical fruit flavors. A nice edge of acidity adds a clean, bright mouthfeel.",Sutcliffe 2011 Pinot Gris (Carneros)
"This extremely dark-colored Malbec offers mellow blueberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is big, jammy feeling and features only pokes of acidic cut. Inky black-fruit flavors come with licorice, peppercorn notes and heat. The finish is solid but limited in scope. Drink now through 2016.",TintoNegro 2010 Finca la Escuela Estate Grown Altamira Malbec (Mendoza)
"Jammy aromas of baked blackberry and plum are fiery at first and then flatten out with airing. A choppy palate offers a bumpy ride with ripe plum and berry flavors in front of a full-force, toasty finish that shows a strong grip courtesy of big tannins. This is two-thirds Garnacha with Syrah and Carignan.",Altavins 2009 Tempus Red (Terra Alta)
"This is a fragrant and generous Chardonnay from Piedmont that shows bright tones of melon, exotic fruit and pineapple. The wine is rich and smooth in the mouth and grips the palate in a very satisfactory manner.",Tenuta Olim Bauda 2008 I Boschi Chardonnay (Piedmont)
"A light, lemony and crisp Chardonnay with a long, lemony finish begging for fresh seafood and spice—think fish tacos—Husch's Vine One has a hint of just-ripe pear layered in, too. Refreshing and aromatic, this is an all-around great value that'll pair well with a wide range of foods.",Husch 2011 Vine One Chardonnay (Anderson Valley)
"There's an evident note of tart grapefruit that segues almost immediately to sweeter tones of peach and honeydew melon. That slight sweetness is backed by creamy foam and soft, smooth perlage.",Bortolotti 2012 Extra Dry 47  (Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"While this is fiery on the nose, you also get attractive, complex aromas of baked cherry, brandied plum, leather, coffee and chocolate. The flavor profile consists of red berry, chocolaty oak and spice, and things conclude with savory, roasted flavors cut by lasting acidity. This is a powerful, tannic yet sophisticated Nebbiolo that should improve with more time in the bottle.",Cava Aragon 2011 Madera 5 Nebbiolo (San Vicente)
"This is a big, robust, country-style Zin, that's power packed with fruit. The blackberry, blueberry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors go to your head fast, like Port. Bring your designated driver and enjoy with grilled beef.",Chiarello Family Vineyards 2010 Giana Zinfandel (St. Helena)
"Costebianche refers to the calcium-rich soils in the vineyards of this estate in Piedmont, northern Italy.

"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak.",B.R. Cohn 2007 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A candied element of butterscotch, caramel and dried apricot opens the nose of this luminous and bright Chardonnay. The wine is smooth and soft in the mouth with enduring flavors of stone fruit and mineral (in fact, vineyard soils are heavy in chalk content). Baglio del Cristo is Sicily's hottest new winery to watch.",Baglio del Cristo di Campobello 2007 Laudàri Chardonnay (Sicilia)
This is a lovely Chardonnay from Tuscany with a full bouquet of honey and stone fruit aromas. The wine is thick and rich in texture with impressive intensity and persistency on the finish.,Castello Banfi 2008 Fontanelle Chardonnay (Toscana)
"A classically sweet Welschriesling, not too heavy or cloying, but ripe with juicy peaches and dried apricots enriched with honey. There is a hint of drier botrytis to give the wine a fine texture. Drink now, not for aging. Screwcap.",Gunter Triebaumer 2007 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland)

"Remarkably consistent in quality year after year, Peg Bay's 2007 Chardonnay opens with some slightly funky aromas that moderate with aeration to reveal a toasty, smoky wine with a core of melon fruit. It starts off seeming a touch narrow, but broadens and deepens on the palate, ending with impressive length.",Pegasus Bay 2007 Chardonnay (Waipara Valley)

The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the wine would taste great with risotto and wild mushrooms.",Tasca d'Almerita 2007 Tenuta Regaleali Chardonnay (Sicilia)
"Here's a luminous and bright Chardonnay with a well-balanced aromatic offering that spans from toasted nut to chalky mineral to exotic fruit. Overall, the wine tastes smooth and creamy, but there are a few sharp points of acidity that help move it along the palate. It's a sophisticated white wine in a very elegant bottle.",Tenuta Rapitalà 2007 Grand Cru Chardonnay (Sicilia)
"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse.

Intensely flavorful in the mouth, this wine finishes on a long note of lemon zest and white cherries. An excellent foil for roast pork.",Domaine de la Mordorée 2009 La Dame Rousse  (Tavel)
"Beautifully perfumed wine, with fresh red fruits and some fine tannins. The wood element is perhaps too dominant for the weight of the wine. Hopefully this will subside. Give it 3–4 years.",Domaine Faiveley 2007 Les Rugiens Premier Cru  (Pommard)
"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors.

"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors.

"From the new, négociant side of Domaine Jessiaume, now owned by Scottish businessman Sir David Murray. The wine hints at the grandeur possible from Clos de Vougeot without quite achieving it. The power is there, but without the black richness. Instead, there are fine tannins, firm dark fruit skins and elegance. Age for 3–4 years.",Maison Jessiaume 2006  Clos de Vougeot
"Just delicious. Feels soft and lush and chocolaty in the mouth, with melted blackberry and cherry flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie.

Drink now.",Hubert Weber 2007 Cellar Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)

The finish tires just a bit, leaving a residual impression of green tea tannins.",Ponzi 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"An enticing and savory nose of clove, spice, pepper and a touch of smoke lead on this classy Pinotage. Though the wine has a refreshing edge, it's complex and sultry, with an elegant balance of red fruit, plum and smoke and a round but vibrant character. Pair with heartier beef dishes or sip alone.",Spier 2005 Pinotage (Stellenbosch)
"A little herbal and funky, which is probably due to the 30% Carmenère that has been mixed with Cabernet Sauvignon. But once it breathes there's plenty of raw wood, shoe polish and campfire to ponder. Cola, cassis and black cherry are the lead flavors, while the finish has ample wood and vanilla along with some lasting leafiness.

"Reserve is rarely a word found in front of rosé, but here it seems meaningful. The 82% Merlot and 18% Grenache complement each other nicely.

"This dark, dry, tannic wine is rich in blackberries and cherries, with earthy notes of mushrooms and herbs. It's pretty tight and astringent now, but should soften over the next 5–6 years. The blend is Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional and Souzão.",PasoPort 2009 Vinho Tinto Red (Paso Robles)

"This Shiraz-based blend, with 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, is bold and layered, taking time to unfold and develop in the glass.

"One-quarter of this wine was fermented in neutral oak, the rest in stainless steel. At 12.5% alcohol, the light, almost airy wine brings immaculate fruit flavors of apple and pear, with a pleasing, minerally mouthfeel. It offers the faintest suggestion of caramel as it winds down.",St. Innocent 2015 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"Soft yet perky strawberry aromas meet licorice, fennel bulb and cinnamon on the nose of this well balanced Zinfandel from a historic vineyard.

"This eponymous label of winemaker Nathaniel Rose is one of his many endeavors in the Michigan wine scene. While the name “Left Bank” evokes Bordeaux, this is clearly a New World-style red, boasting bouncy fruit aromas of dark cherry and spiced raspberry, with cola and cough-syrup notes in the background.

"Named after the barn owl (Tyto alba) that nests in the woods of the Lezirias estate, this has great tannins that give shape to the dense black fruits.

"This village-designated Priorat is dry, spicy and fresh on the nose, with notes of mountain herbs as well as lively raspberry, plum and currant. It feels wide and packed with power and purity.

Notes of saline and energizing mineral close the lingering finish. Drink through 2020.",Gini 2013 La Froscà  (Soave Classico)

It could be drunk now, but will be better from 2016.",Aveleda 2013 Reserva da Familia White (Bairrada)
"While it has lost its primary fruit, this wine has gained richness, toastiness and structure. Caramel and almond flavors stand out from the firm texture and the concentration. It is a complex wine that has weight and ripeness. Drink now.",Bonnet-Huteau 2010 Goulaine Vieilles Vignes  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)
"This esteemed winery's younger Chardonnays are all about tension and the future. This begins with slightly sour aromas of yogurt and goat cheese along with shave fennel, radish, daikon and lemongrass. The palate is power by citrusy pith, brine and nectarine peels, with just the tiniest touch of green apple ripeness. Drink 2018–2024.",Brewer-Clifton 2012 Machado Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is a rich, dense Pinot, with blackberries, sweet cloves, allspice, gingerbread and nutmeg aromas.

The entire package finishes with a bang of crisp red-cherry fruit.",Les Belles Collines 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A study of umami, this wine shows shiitake mushrooms, decomposing wood, soy and hibiscus on the nose.

It's focused yet expansive.",Wrath 2012 Swan/828 Pinot Noir (Monterey)
"A special bottling made by the producer to honor her late son, this wine is dark and brooding, offering a depth and warmth of baked plum and blackberry seasoned in cardamom, with a satisfying finish of coffee.

"From a warm vineyard site in a cool year, this Cab intrigues in sage and chewy black cherry, possessed of a powerful, buoyant minerality.

"From the coastal plain of the Beiras, this cool and structured blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional has a fine poise between acidity and sweet berry fruits. It's a complex, textured wine. Fresh and fruity on the one hand and dark and brooding on the other, it needs time, so drink from 2017.",Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2011 Red (Beira Atlantico)
"With 12 months wood aging, this powerful wine has managed to keep a great sense of balance. Solid tannins are tempered by a more dusty texture, smooth black plum fruits, rich, concentrated acidity and juicy final fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",Herdade do Esporão 2011 Esporão Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"Deep, dense black cherry signals immediately that this is pure, classic Dundee Hills fruit, much of it from Abbey Ridge. Average vine age is 30 years—giving it great penetration and complexity. At first tight and unyielding, it opens with scents of coffee and chocolate, and displays the thick minerality of all the winery's 2012s. Nuanced herbs add a peppery kick to the finish.",J. Christopher 2012 Sandra Adele Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Hints of bramble and mint meld into fresh black cherries and violets in this very pretty, profoundly aromatic Pinot Noir. It's elegantly composed yet richly concentrated, finishing amidst a lingering spray of lavender blossoms and herbs.",Maximin Grünhäuser 2011 Spätburgunder (Mosel)
"French oak aging has given this still-young wine a firmly structured character, with dark tannins and a firm texture. It's still very dry, structured and dark and needs a good few years to age and round out. For now, the ripe fruit and acidity are both showing great promise. Drink from 2018.",Quinta da Rede 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)
"Quinta Nova has produced two Grand Reservas in 2012. This is leaner than the other, a more structured wine with dry tannins and great concentration.

"Juicy in cassis and black cherry before taking on beguiling layers of peppercorn, chicory, tobacco and black tea, this Cab has a lot going on from the get-go, and yet there's no doubt about its ability to take on further nuance and complexity with time. Bittersweet chocolate accents the finish. Enjoy through 2027–2030.",Ad Vivum 2012 Sleeping Lady Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"Gavin Chanin's take on this vineyard shows lots of dark but never heavy spice on the nose, with bergamot, white sage and damp eucalyptus forest complementing the raspberry fruit.

"This is the second wine from the Pintas vineyard in the heart of the Pinhão valley. It's powered by mint, dark plums and new wood flavors to give a richly concentrated, juicy wine.

"Winemaker Sabrine Rodems lays on exciting aromas of light pomegranate juice decorated by toasted sagebrush, charred fennel, pan-toasted peppercorns, graphite and pine ash.

"Alicante Bouschet, a grape that has red juice as well as skins, produces rich and darkly colored wines. This wood-aged Reserva is a concentrated and tannic example. It's also ripe and full-bodied, a bold wine that packs a big punch. The wood aging shows well, reinforcing the fresher black juiciness of the wine. Drink from 2017.",Herdade das Servas 2011 Reserva Alicante Bouschet (Alentejano)
"Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling. It seems atypically round for such a young Eden Valley Riesling, so maybe not a long-term proposition, but it goes down easily now, with a long, slightly oily finish.",Henschke 2007 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)
"This is a structured, balanced white with aromas of gooseberry, flint and spice on the nose, and flavors of fresh citrus and fruit on the palate. Clean and crisp but offering complexity, this wine marries rich fruit and cracking acid very successfully. Pair with spicy Indian cuisine, grilled seafood.",Brampton 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"This is the first vintage under its new owner, the American Stephen Adams. It's relatively soft, with black currant fruits, given a delicious lift by some tight tannins. The acidity gives freshness, a zap to the dry, firm finish.",Château de Bel-Air 2005  Lalande de Pomerol
"Not quite as impressive as some other vintages, the 2002 Print Shiraz boasts plenty of color but lacks some nuance and freshness.

It's big and mouthfilling, with 15% alcohol.",Mitchelton 2002 Print Shiraz (Central Victoria)
"Shows green fruit and slightly herbal nuances on the nose, then delivers crystalline structure and purity of lime fruit and liquid minerals in the mouth. Although only light to medium in body, this is a powerhouse, with a long finish.",Müller-Catoir 2007 Haardt Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"This wine shows tremendous minerality for a wine from a mix of parcels. Almost smoky, saline mineral aromas combine with crisp, citrusy fruit to typify the Pfalz dry Riesling style. Picks up hints of orange and clove on the finish, with a suggestion of citrus pith.",Pfeffingen 2007 Dry Riesling (Pfalz)
"Fans of this sometimes kinky grape variety will probably feel this rating is too low. This wine starts of with hints of Scheurebe's wild side, offering up hints of something resembling Sauvignon Blanc, then adding almost tropical fruit and currant and pink grapefruit flavors tinged with just enough residual sugar for balance. A wild ride, but an enjoyable one.",Pfeffingen 2007 Ungsteiner Herrenberg Spätlese Scheurebe (Pfalz)
"Coffee, cigarbox and mocha aromas and flavors characterize this Rietvallei red. Complex and assertive, the wine unfolds with a chewy but poised intensity. The lingering finish has a tobacco-like touch. Pair with smoked meats, rich stews.",Rietvallei Estate Wine 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Robertson)
"Fragrant, smoky, oaky and seductive, this toasty wine is immediately appealing, and has been given the all-star treatment. The young vineyard offers promising fruit; its flavors light and clean, tasting of raspberries and pie cherries. Lots of oak gives it a very chocolaty finish.",Robert Karl 2005 Gunselman Bench Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"We've noticed traces of volatility in past Sesti Brunellos, but the 2004 vintage smells polished and pristine. Aromas of black fruit, spice and cured meat are intact, generous and are delivered with uplifting force and buoyancy. This helps contribute to the general intensity of the wine and the supple nature of its mouthfeel.",Sesti 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"Podere Paganico offers an impressive level of aromatic complexity thanks to layers of forest floor, dried apricot, underbrush, wet earth, cured meats and dried apple skins. It's a chewy, big wine with solid texture and firm tannins.",Podere Paganico 2004  Brunello di Montalcino
"At first, this Riesling looks sort of bland and troubled—the aromas are nondescript, the mouthfeel broad. But this wine really improves given time—the melon and peach fruit comes alive and crisp, citrusy notes assert themselves on the finish.",J.L. Wolf 2006 Wachenheimer Belz Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz)
"More yellow than Lustau's manzanilla, Jarana is a lovely, proper fino with a nose of iodine, lemon blossom and popcorn. The palate is staunch and doesn't back down; the high-toned nut and citrus flavors seem classic and elevated. And the finish is intense and frames everything in walnut oil and toast.",Lustau NV Light Fino Jarana Sherry (Jerez)
"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard.",:Nota Bene 2006 Verhey Vineyard Malbec (Yakima Valley)
"This is a somewhat soft and friendly wine, filled with ripe peaches and pears, and with a backbone of lime-like citrus. It even boasts a subtle dose of minerality. Yet it lacks the power and precision of some of the other Rebholz wines, instead settling for being soft and cuddly rather than profound.",Ökonomierat Rebholz 2007 Von Rotliegenden Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz)
"This “great growth” is richly concentrated, even a bit syrupy in texture, although almost totally dry in style. Pear, peach and pineapple aromas and flavors give the impression of fruit nectar, then pick up enough salty minerality on the finish to add interest and provide balance.",Fitz-Ritter 2006 Dürkheimer Michelsberg Grosses Gewächs Riesling (Pfalz)
Ripe peaches are glazed with honey and dusted with crushed stone in this sweet wine that's lush and honeyed yet manages to retain some measure of restraint. A hint of citrus pith on the finish provides balance.,Geh. Rat Dr. von Bassermann-Jordan 2006 Deidesheimer Leinhöhle Spätlese Riesling (Pfalz)
"Dark colored wine, with ripe black plum flavors that lie over solidly textured tannins. Structured to bring out the fruit, the wine also has a core of wood, spice, dark cocoa and black currant acidity to finish. An attractive wine that is worth aging for another two years.",Château Franc-Cardinal 2005  Bordeaux Côtes de Francs 
"A new wood aged selection of vines from Château Haut Beyzac, a property being restored by Pennsylvanian Daren Miller and his French in-laws.

"This six-year-old blend of 46% Syrah, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot is showing its age, with aromas of reduced cherry sauce, tar and cocoa dust. The rustic palate is full of leather, tobacco, dried cherries and dusty earth flavors. Still interesting, but drink up soon.",Reyes 2011 Robby's Red (California)
"Aromas of black plum, vanilla and a whiff underbrush lead the nose. Made with 80% Corvina, 10% Corvinone and 10% Rondinella, the light-bodied palate shows blackberry jam, clove and a hint of cocoa alongside loose-knit tannins. Drink soon.",Santi 2015 Ventale  (Valpolicella Superiore)

"This crisp tightly woven white is showy in fresh-cut grass and gooseberry flavors, with an underlying grasp of grapefruit and lemon. The texture is gritty.",Séamus Wines 2014 Shannon Wood Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"The nose is rather shy but eventually shows earthy aromas of grilled herb, charcuterie and ground clove. The aromas follow over to the juicy, rather rustic palate along with red cherry and a funky hint of game. It's easy drinking, with loose, somewhat fleeting tannins.",Tenuta Casaletti 2016  Valpolicella
"This is a rounded mouth-filling wine that takes mild watermelon aromas and adds subtle white peach and pear flavors. It's quite rich in texture, low in acidity and alcohol, and has a lingering finish.",Uphill Vineyards 2016 Estate Grown Rosato di Primitivo (Amador County)
"This Cabernet Franc has pronounced aromas of red and black cherries, violets, lavender, licorice and juniper berries.

"This ripe wine is full of apple and pear fruit with a touch of citrus. It is full, the acidity just pointing up the richness. There are almond flavors as well as spice from the wood aging. Drink from 2018.",Adega Vila Real 2016 Premium White (Douro)
"Lean, racy aromas of green fruits and cactus pad announce a pinched, zingy, high-acid palate. Briny, lightly green citrus flavors finish tight and chalky, with raw acidity that you can feel on your teeth and gums.",Agustinos 2016 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Bío Bío Valley)
"Tart, firm and simple, this wine lacks complexity and structure somewhat, providing quiet flavors of leather saddle and cedar amongst a soft rounded tannin profile.",Arbor Bench Vineyards 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"While the familiar white version of this wine is from Vinho Verde, the producers have gone a little further south to the Douro for the red. That gives a soft wine but with weight and attractive layers of red-berry fruits and a touch of warmth. Drink now.",Aveleda 2015 Casal Garcia Red (Douro)
"Apple, melon and a touch of vanilla give a tasty spectrum of aromas and flavors to this medium-bodied wine. It's light enough to sip easily but has a bit of depth to the flavors that makes it interesting.",Belle Ambiance 2016 Pinot Grigio (California)
The smoky oaky aromas and spicy peppery flavors of this medium-bodied wine are undeniable and definitely dominate whatever modest fruit flavors lie underneath. It's an assertive wine with a brash flavor profile.,Bogle 2016 Chardonnay (California)
"This wine is perfumed, ripe and soft. It shows the richness of the vintage with plenty of warm fruit. Lemon flavors lend a final lift to richer apricot and pear notes. Drink now.",Château Gardut Haut Cluzeau 2016  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
"This blend, dominated by Sémillon and Sauvignon Gris, gives a rich, perfumed and ripe-tasting wine. Acidity balances its full apricot and pear fruit flavors. With its creamy texture, it's ready to drink.",Château La Fleur Ribeyrolles 2016  Entre-Deux-Mers
"This wine is dry and likely to remain so. That's because the black currant flavors are too light for the structure, resulting in high acidity, firm tannins and a hole in the middle.",Château Larrivaux 2013  Haut-Médoc
"Charred oak aromas settle on creamy, with a note of plastic to go with heavy spice and secondary berry scents. This feels raw, tannic and grabby. Flavors of plum and clove are woody, while this has the texture of grape-skin extract on the finish, meaning it's rough and grabby.",Chilensis 2015 Reserva Estate Bottled Malbec (Maule Valley)
"On the riper spectrum rather than youthful and fresh, this shows wet wool, ripe lemons and stone fruit, with a hint of green beans and florals. The palate is backed by searing acidity and a slightly woolly texture. Rather simple in style but it clearly shows the characters of both the Sauvignon Blanc and the Sémillon.",Clairault 2016 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)
"Dark-skinned berry and ground clove aromas lift out of the glass. Reflecting the nose, the no-frills, enjoyable palate offers Marasca cherry and a black-pepper note alongside easygoing tannins. It's simple but well made.",Delibori 2016  Bardolino Classico
"This wine is packed with flavor from the ripe blend of Shiraz, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Nacional. Its berry fruits and balanced acidity give the wine an easy, juicy character. The gentle tannins are easily integrated with the fruit. Drink now.",DFJ Vinhos 2016 Brigando Red (Lisboa)
"Ripe and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine has lots of butter and vanilla in the aromas, a flavor almost as rich as a vanilla milkshake, and a buttery texture.",Feist 2014 Chardonnay (California)
"There's a fair lick of dried wood notes on this straightforward sipper. The fruity strawberry and blueberry core is plush and pleasing, as is the soft grip of tannins at the backend.",Hardys 2014 Stamp of Australia Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)
"This medium-sweet wine brings aromas of acacia flowers and lemon lime zest to the fore. In the mouth there are flavors of honeycomb, lemon and acacia flower. The finish is delightful and slightly sweet.",Jidvei 2016 Treasure of Transylvania Medium Sweet Gewurztraminer (Tarnave)
"Nutty, woody and tannic, this is a broadly etched wine. It is ripe and extracted, with simple layers of black cherry, cinnamon and cola.",Karah Estate 2015 Estate Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Red currant aromas are an immediately attractive start for this light, fruity wine. With its crisp acidity and bright red currant and raspberry fruit, it's lively and ready to drink.",Les Rocailles 2016 Rosé (Savoie)
"Lightly pink in color, this sweet sparkling wine is full of ripe strawberry fruit. And with its low alcohol, it's the perfect pairing for strawberries and cream. Acidity keeps it in balance.",Les Rocailles NV Caprice des Rocailles Gamay (Savoie)
"Cigar box and very ripe strawberry dominate the aromatic profile, though a bit of bell pepper lingers in the background. It's light and racy on the palate, with cherry cola, cedar and mellow tannins, making for a very fresh and fun wine, best served after mild chilling.",Brander 2012 Merlot (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This blend of Merlot and Tempranillo, with touches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, opens with notes of warm cherry pie, black tobacco and cedar. Fresh boysenberry starts the palate, with mouthwatering spice in the midpalate and mocha on the finish.",Haka by Labyrinth 2010 Freebird Red (Paso Robles)
"A Syrah-esque bit of smoke and cured meat wafts from this wine aromatically, which follows through on the palate. Bright cherry and currant fruit then intermix with a restrained sense of clove spice, the Stagecoach Cab blended with Malbec and Petit Verdot, aged in 60% new French oak.",Krutz 2010 Stagecoach Vineyard Limited Edition Artist Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This bright, medium-bodied red opens with aromas of underbrush, rose, violet and ripe berry. The lively palate offers juicy dark cherry, black raspberry, orange peel and a hint of baking spice alongside fresh acidity and lithe tannins.",Monchiero Carbone 2012 Sire Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Broad, ripe berry aromas are dark and full on the nose. The palate is lively, with a shot of bracing acidity. Flavors of dark fruit, grilled meat, herb and salt finish briny, with a final wave of hard tannins. Drink through 2016.",Montes 2011 Alpha Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"This bold, dry, firmly tannic wine will taste good now with rich foods, but could easily improve with aging through 2017. It is deeply colored, full bodied and a bit sandy in texture, yet that grip seems O.K. in this wine, balanced by the ripe fruit flavors.",Naggiar 2010 Don Giovanni Estate Grown Red (Sierra Foothills)
"This amber colored, orange-style wine has aromas of canned peaches and apricots on the nose, while fresh stone fruits seem to dominate the full bodied palate. The finish is creamy and lingers on.",Batič 2009 Angel Grande Cuvée Rezerva White (Vipavska Dolina)
"This wine is garnet in color, with aromas of cherry, vanilla, red plum and cassis. Flavors of tart cherry, red raspberry and blackberry drive the palate and lead to a lingering finish.",Batič 2010 Cabernet Franc (Vipavska Dolina)
"Straightforward and easy-drinking, this starts off with aromas of red rose, violet and red berry. The bright palate offers up wild cherry layered with notes of cinnamon and white pepper balanced with zesty acidity and chewy tannins.",Borgognot 2010  Barolo
"Pretty aromas suggest violet, rose, strawberry and mint. The vibrant palate offers red cherry, crushed raspberry and cinnamon alongside supple tannins and bright acidity. Enjoy through 2017.",Ca' del Baio 2012 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"While light in color, this rich wine is full of both fruit and tannin. It has real Pinot Noir cherry and strawberry flavors, lightened by cool acidity. The structure comes from the rich wood flavors and the complex tannins. Drink from 2015.",Charles Sparr 2011 Leimengrub Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"The wine has the typical Provence rosé color—a pale, elegant pink-grey. The flavors though are rich, full and powerful. It is packed with sweet ripe strawberries, very smooth and luscious.",Château Henri Bonnaud 2013 Rosé (Palette)
"This is full of superripe red fruits, full-bodied and concentrated. It offers spice as well as fruitiness, both well integrated and given a lift by the attractive lemon acidity. It's a rosé for winter and could match turkey with its weight and density.",Château la Coste 2013 Bellugue Rosé (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)
"Firm and solidly structured, this is a dense wine. It has plenty of tannins and a touch of bitter chocolate, but they are supported by the ripe fruit and fresh black currant flavors. It's a wine for aging, drink from 2017.",Château Lagrave 2012 Le Second  (Saint-Émilion)
"From a Merlot-dominated, 24-acre vineyard this is a strongly mineral wine, with young, dark tannins and a powerful structure. A more juicy, fruity side brings out black currants and berries. Together the structure and the fruit promise good aging. Drink from 2017.",Château le Moulin d'Ulysse 2011  Haut-Médoc
"Ripe and full, it offers great spice, yellow fruits and hints of tropical fruits. It has acidity and is dry, but it's delicious because of its rounded texture and generous body. Drink from 2015.",Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2012 Le Berger Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Intense aromas recall forest floor, tobacco, dark berry and grilled herb. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, black pepper and balsamic notes alongside big, brooding tannins. The warmth of alcohol shows on the midpalate.",Elvio Cogno 2011 Bordini  (Barbaresco)
"This well-balanced red made from a variety used in Port wines grows on you with each sip. It has bright cherry and raspberry aromas, exotic floral flavors, good acidity, a smooth texture and medium body. It should be versatile with food.",Wise Villa 2012 Estate Grown and Produced Touriga Nacional (Sierra Foothills)
"Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins.",Broken Earth 2010 CV Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Layered with toasty wood, this rich wine delivers blackberry fruits, a strong sense of tannins that enrich the fruit, and a concentrated aftertaste. From one of several small properties tended by owners Christophe and Marie Jo Lavau, it will age well. Drink from 2017.",Château Terrasson 2012 Cuvée Prevenche  (Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux)
"Aromas suggest violet, black plum, crushed black cherry and wild strawberry. The intense fruit sensations carry over to the palate with a note of white pepper, while robust but fine tannins lend structure.",Cleto Chiarli 2013 Vigneto Cialdini  (Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro)
"This opens with a blast of resiny oak, but airing calms things down, and ultimately the bouquet is round and full, with a mix of wood, vanilla and tropical fruit aromas. This is chalky, minerally and full in feel, accented by apple, pear, melon and spice flavors. Leftover oak and savory spice flavors dominate the finish.",Concha y Toro 2013 Marques de Casa Concha Chardonnay (Limarí Valley)
"A dark and richly dense wine, this is packed with black fruit notes and concentrated tannins. Aged in French and American oak, it has a strongly spicy character, with bright acid and a solid tannic structure. Drink after 2015.",Caves Aliança 2011 Alabastro Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"One of a pair of wines from Palayson blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. This, with its 80% Syrah and 20% Cabernet, is perfumed and spicy. With great violet aromas and firm spice and tannin, it does show power and alcohol. At the same time, it has the potential to round out into a smooth and full-bodied wine. Drink from 2017.",Château de Palayson 2009 Grande Cuvée Cabernet-Syrah (Var)
"Here's a solid wine full of both tannins and dark fruits. New oak barrels give a spicy character while supporting the fruitiness. A blend of 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon from only 10 acres, it is developing into a rich wine that still needs time. Drink this impressive wine from 2018.",Château des Matards 2012 Cuvée Nathan  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"This wine is electric pink in color, with notes of strawberry bubblegum and cranberry. It drinks off dry, with watermelon and red fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",Columbia Winery 2013 Grenache Rosé (Horse Heaven Hills)
"This 90% Syrah and 10% Grenache blend, named as an ode to the winemaker's butcher-ancestors, begins with scents of blueberry crème brûlée with a spearmint glaze. The flavors are comparably light, with tarter blueberry, some licorice on the midpalate and a tannic finish.",Comartin 2011 The Porterhouse Syrah-Grenache (Central Coast)
"The pretty but powerful nose is like striking a gusher of black gold in a field of lavender, full of tar, violet and blueberry. Leather and deep purple fruit lead the palate, with charred meat savoriness, black pepper spice and plum skin tannins making a good case for this seven-acre vineyard that was planted in 1998.",Cooper-Garrod 2010 Finley Vineyard Estate Syrah (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A blend of 57% Merlot, 37% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Syrah, this opens with a sweetly spiced bouquet of red and purple fruits. The medium weight midpalate brings tart plum and cherry flavors, plentiful acidity and moderate, balanced tannins. Drink now through 2020.",Dunham 2011 Trutina Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This ripe, sweet-fruited wine is soft and quite mature. Red fruits have developed into a smooth and round texture with a delicate mushroom character. Drink now.",Hugel 2009 Jubiléé Pinot Noir (Alsace)
"Profound enough for serious contemplation but with enough broad fruit appeal to serve to a crowd. There's loads of upfront Asian spice and lychee, afloat on a luxurious, sensually textured palate. Notes of geranium and macadamia nuts keep the taste buds entertained and carry over to the lingering finish. The noticeable residual sugar suggests pairing with something slightly sweet, like Tilapia in a mango salsa. Drink now to 2011.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2007 Wintzheim Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Hobo's Zins are almost always among the most balanced and elegant out there, while preserving the variety's spicy, briary personality. This lovely single-vineyard bottling is dry and refined, showing complex flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and spices. Drink now.",Hobo 2008 Treborce Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
This Millesimato sparkling blend of Pinot Nero and oak-aged Chardonnay delivers a generous and creamy mouthfeel followed by refined aromas of dried fruit and baked bread. This is a beautiful wine to serve with tempura appetizers.,La Montina 2005 Millesimato Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"You can taste the age here in the wine's sophisticated and evolved aromas of butterscotch, caramel, dried fruit and pressed flower petal. In fact, this wine comes from the far away 2000 vintage but has beautifully maintained its fruit characteristics and overall crispness.",La Valle 2000 Zerum Riserva Dosaggio Zero Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"My favorite of Grant Taylor's 2008s, the Bannockburn bottling displays elegant lacings of vanilla and cinnamon over black cherries, then adds subtle meaty and herbal nuances. It's medium bodied and supple in texture, with a long, silky finish. Drink now–2015.",Valli 2008 Bannockburn Vineyard Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"A lovely wine that makes the case for bottling Cab Franc on its own. Shows beautifully ripe, fine Napa tannins with complex flavors of red cherries, red currants, licorice, cola and cedar. Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford)
"At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday. Brims with ripe blackberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar, with a nice cut of acidity and ultrarefined tannins. Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3–5 years to mellow.",Brion 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The bulkiness that characterized earlier vintages of this Merlot-based blend has been tamed in this vintage, and the 2007 is a remarkably harmonious, elegant blend of ripe cherries, dried spices, chocolate and cedar. Supple tannins fade gracefully on the finish. Drink now–2018.",Craggy Range 2007 Sophia Gimblett Gravels Red (Hawke's Bay)
"Peju's regular Cab Franc, released a year ago, was immediately drinkable. This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors. Fine now, and should develop for 5–7 years.",Peju 2006 Reserve Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Rutherford)
"Harrison's Cabernet is a bit hard in youth, marked by strong tannins that make for an astringent mouthfeel. It's also somewhat linear in varietal flavor, with ripe black currants and blackberries and a certain minerality. Not drinkable now, but all indications are for a good future. Better after 2012.",William Harrison 2006 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A big, bold and beautiful Cabernet. Will appeal to those who like the California style, although Bordeauxphiles will find it too ripe and fruity. Brims with blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and sweet toasted oak, wrapped into firm, mountain tannins. Now–2014.",Barnett 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"There are impressive aromas here of stone and passion fruits, dried herbs and thick, nutty overtones at the back. The acidity is refreshing and cool but the wine also boasts solid, firm structure. Try this sparkler with smoked salmon canapés.",Bellavista NV Gran Cuvée Satèn Chardonnay (Franciacorta)
"The private project of veteran winemaker Robert Brittan, the limited-production wines under his own label are treasures. This is his inaugural release. Both fruit ripeness and meaty depth are here in abundance, with a complex mix of tree fruits and stone fruits, streaks of earth and a fine layering of chocolate. This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises.",Brittan Vineyards 2006 Basalt Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This is powerful, a fine expression of the richness of 2005. Dense and dusty tannins fit in the structure of ripe, black plums and currants. It has just the right amount of acidity to keep fresh among all this richness.",Château Coutet 2005  Saint-Émilion
"Teso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Moët Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.",Teso La Monja 2007 Almirez  (Toro)
"Lifted cherry and floral aromatics carry with them a hint of barrel char in this medium-bodied, elegantly styled blend of 51% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Petit Verdot, 11% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec. It's admirably supple and harmonious from start to finish. Drink now–2015.",Trinity Hill 2007 The Gimblett Red (Hawke's Bay)
"Doesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.",Kendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley)
"New oak dominates this young wine, with vanilla-accented buttered toast and smoky aromas. Underneath the wood are strong, complex flavors of raspberries, cherries, licorice, cola and Asian spices. With fine tannins and acidity, it seems to be a natural for the cellar. Hold until after 2011.",Merry Edwards 2007 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a late-harvest dessert wine blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc. It's very rich and very sweet and very easy to like. Backed up with firm acidity, it shows extraordinarily ripe flavors of pineapples, apricots, oranges, honey, crème brûlée, vanilla bean, buttered toast and cinnamon spices.",Miraflores 2006 Botricelli Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A beautiful Zin, dry and spicy. Shows lush, intricate flavors of blackberries, black raspberries, anise, pepper, cola and cedar. A very fine interpretation of a dusty Sonoma Zinfandel.",Hobo 2008 Branham Rockpile Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"Still quite young, but showing real depth and layering, the McCrone vineyard designate offers pomegranate and raspberry fruit, dusted with baking spices, and finished with a tasty vein of mocha. This is a wine to enjoy in the full bloom of its youth.",Ken Wright 2008 McCrone Vineyard Pinot Noir
"Truly stunning, this white starts out with subtle talcum powder and gravel notes, then adds intense perfume and peaches in the mouth. There's a finely tuned balance and good length. Exceptional harmony and intensity suggest it will improve for 15 years or more.",Markus Molitor 2008 Zeltinger Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"This soft, tank-aged wine has attractive apple fruits, a touch of citrus and crisp acidity. Light and fruity, it is ready to drink.",Bernier 2014 Chardonnay (Val de Loire)
"With a light prickle on the tongue, this is a fresh and fruity wine that has sweetness balanced by a citric edge. It's crisp and ready to drink.",Campelo 2014 Casal da Seara White (Vinho Verde)
"Made to be drunk young, this is a fruity red berry flavored wine. It has a bright crisp edge to its fruit as well as light tannins and acidity. It is quite ready to drink.",Cartuxa 2014 Vinea Tinto Red (Alentejano)
"Closed aromas of red fruits, wet cement and green herbs precede a flat fairly tannic palate. Grinding cherry and plum flavors finish with hard tannins and midland rubbery red-fruit flavors.",Ricordi 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Earthy stalky leathery aromas suggest modest ripeness. This feels medium in weight, while short salty flavors of plum and raspberry are herbal and arguably a touch weedy. This feels a little hot on the finish.",Septima 2014 Malbec (Mendoza)
This wine is somewhat diluted and one-dimensional. It makes a straightforward attempt at bringing a richness of apple and anise to the fore around neutral oak dynamics before finishing ripe and full.,Mossback 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A sweet rosé that is light and fresh from the crisp raspberry acidity. It is bright and fruity, ready to drink.",Quintas de Melgaço 2014 Lagar Rosé (Vinho Verde)
"Fleshy, unfocused aromas of apple and peach are a touch oxidized. This Chardonnay feels bland. Flavors of melon and peach lack tension and character, while there's not much flavor to the finish other than mild apple and some bitterness.",Bodegas San Valero 2014 Particular Chardonnay (Cariñena)
"Reduced in a weight of oak and tight tannins, this wine takes time to come around and develop any juiciness to the palate, offering a mix of red cherry and cranberry laced in forest and spice. It finishes quick and lean.",Halleck 2013 Three Sons Cuvee Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Somewhat disjointed, this watery effort hints at berry flavors, with a bit of road tar and cola.",Henry Estate 2014 Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)
"Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.",Luis Segundo Correas 2011 Valle Las Acequias Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Baked bread and brown sugar make this a comforting wine in some sense. Similarly, the fruit follows a baked quality that makes it taste bigger than it is. Meanwhile, herbal leanings betray the wine's low level of alcohol.",Ramspur 2012 Otton Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Fleshy aromas of melon and peach are leesy and soft. This is more angular and acidic on the palate, which fails to fan out. Nectarine and salty briny flavors finish with papaya and peach notes.",Aljibes 2014 VA Viña Aljibes Sauvignon Blanc-Chardonnay (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Leesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness. The palate is regular in feel, with adequate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lettuce and herbs culminate with mild bitterness and green notes.",Baron De Ley 2014 White (Rioja)
"Made in a relatively light-bodied, soft style, this wine has a weedy, herbal element at its heart, and could use more fruit to balance out. It ends in a taste of bittersweet chocolate and espresso.",Buena Vista 2012 Merlot (Carneros)
"For a Cahors, this is a surprisingly light and gently fruity wine. It is dry, with some tannic character, but it is much more about youthful black fruit flavors than it is about structure. It is ready to drink now",Clément Bosquet 2014 Malbec (Cahors)
"Made from Syrah, this pink-colored rosé is ripe and full. Full-on strawberry flavors have a bitter edge as well as acidity. It needs to be drunk now.",Domaine d'Arton 2014 Ysé Rosé (Côtes de Gascogne)
"A tropical fruit flavored wine with yellow fruits, pineapple and mango. It is soft and very ripe although still showing some of the fresher acidity that should be in an Alvarinho wine. It's a long way from the cool north of Portugal.",Adega Cooperativa de Borba 2014 Senses Alvarinho (Alentejano)
"Orange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity. Mild apple flavors are sweet, mealy and honeyed, while the ending is leesy and mushy.",Castro Martin 2013 Family Estate Selection Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"An oily bouquet lacks freshness while smelling a bit oxidized and like mushrooms. This has a chunky palate with oxidized, somewhat bitter flavors of papaya and citrus fruits. A pithy mildly bitter finish struggles to show its virtues.",Vieira de Plata 2014 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This wine shows the tropical fruit side of Sauvignon Blanc with pineapple and mango flavors. The acidity is there, floral and ripe. The wine is ready to drink now.",Wines & Winemakers 2014 Companhia das Lezírias Tyto Alba Vinhas Protegidas Sauvignon Blanc (Tejo)
"Light apple and floral aromas lead to rich flavors like apple, honey and grapefruit and a definite sweetness. This wine is fresh and easy to enjoy.",Twisted 2013 Moscato (California)
"Stalky aromas of corn, apple and white flowers lack focus. This feels blocky, while salty flavors of cured ham blend with leesy flavors of papaya and peach. A moderate basic finish is par for the course.",Paso a Paso 2014 White (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Ripe and fruity, this is a rich style of rosé. A blend of Touriga Nacional and Aragonez, it is full of ripe raspberry and red plum flavors that are soft and generous, although lacking acidity. Drink now.",Herdade do Rocim 2014 Mariana Rosé (Alentejano)
"This fresh, vibrant wine is light and fruity. A classic blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon, it has an herbal character along with bright green and citrus fruits. The wine is ready to drink.",Château Laulerie 2014 White (Bergerac Sec)
"Offering a flat opening with no kick, it is akin to sniffing apple juice. This is plump and wan in feel, with melon and banana flavors, while a soft, no-edge finish doesn't leave much of a lasting impression.",Egeo 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Aromas of scorched earth, game, burned rubber and a funky whiff of barnyard waft out of the glass and carry over to the dense palate along with raisin, fig, licorice and a gamy note. It's rustic and extremely evolved with an abrupt, bitter finish.",Costa di Bussia 2011 Vigna Campo del Gatto  (Barbera d'Alba)
"This wine, aged in stainless steel barrels, offers muted berry fruit, somewhat masked by aromas of rubber tire and plastic. The finish is short and slightly bitter.",Oak Knoll 2012 Dion Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"With some earthy, rustic flavors the wine seems to have missed out on some of its fruit. It is more about structure and firm tannins with only hints of juicy fruit behind.",Wines & Winemakers 2013 Monta da Baía Red (Península de Setúbal)
"There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.",Fowles Wine 2012 Are You Game? Pinot Noir (Victoria)
"Direct and thin, this Merlot has simple currant, cocoa, licorice and oakspice flavors that finish totally dry.",Wente 2005 Crane Ridge Merlot (Livermore Valley)
"Simple and sugary, with blackberry and cherry jam flavors and a solid plaster of sweet, caramelized oak. Production was 20,000 cases.",Folie à Deux 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From La Rioja, this Torrontés is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.",Gimenez Riili 2007 Perpetuum Torrontés (La Rioja)
"Few wineries in Argentina make more individual wines than Achaval-Ferrer. And while some are great, others leave you scratching your head or wanting something different. This one has a deep hue but a strange mix of herbal, floral aromas that hint at air freshener. The palate is quite acid-driven and downright sharp, with pounding blueberry and kirsch flavors. More austere and tangy than we prefer.",Achaval-Ferrer 2007 Malbec (Mendoza)
Not much going on in this off-dry wine. It has very thin flavors of vanilla and pineapples.,Baywood 2006 Vineyard Select Symphony (California)
"Way too oaky. Compromised by the clumsy, heavy application of wood. The caramel and roasted butterscotch aromas and flavors completely swamp whatever wine lies beneath.",Wente 2006 The Nth Degree Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)
"This producer in Corgoloin has made a lightweight red Burgundy, with bitter cherry flavors. The tannins are soft, the effect somewhat rustic with an earthy, high acid aftertaste.",Louis d'Armont 2006  Bourgogne
"Simple, tannic and harsh, with sugared blackberry tea, raisin and black pepper flavors.",Midnight 2005 Malbec (Paso Robles)
"De Bortoli's 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir lacks the bright fruit and user-friendliness of its Gulf Station or Windy Peak bottlings. Maybe it's too serious for its own good? This medium-bodied wine features leather, mushroom and molasses, and rather crisp acids as well.",De Bortoli 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
"Aromas of sour cherry and cooked strawberries lead the way in this tart, herbal Pinot Noir. It's lean and crisp, failing to deliver much in the way of pleasure, although there's nothing technically wrong with it.",Giant Steps 2006 Sexton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
"Simple and sweet, this Primitivo has jammy flavors of black raspberries, cherries and chocolate. It's a little heavy and soft.",Brutocao 2005 Contento Vineyard Primitivo (Mendocino)
"This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.",Maryhill 2005 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tastes raisiny, overripe and sweet in cherry jam flavor, with a harsh, peppery mouthfeel. Basically drinkable, but not going anywhere.",Verve 2006 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Like the '03, this Merlot is a little too sweet for comfort, showing sugary cherry flavors that taste like melted jam. It's also very soft and lacks a firm structure.",Deerfield Ranch 2004 Cuveé Merlot (North Coast)
"Edgy, nervy and funky, with unfamiliar aromas and flavors. The nose is pickled and the palate is tart, linear and green. Loses itself as it opens, turning more herbal, sweaty and strange. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",Tamaya 2007 Winemaker's Selection Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Limarí Valley)
"Smells raisiny-Porty, and turns dry and austere in the mouth, with modest currant and oak flavors set off by hard tannins. The official alcohol is only 14.9%, but the wine feels hotter than that.",Arns 2004 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Shows blackberry and cherry flavors that taste candied, almost medicinal. Okay with burgers and pizza.",Jacuzzi 2006 Morine Ranch Primitivo (Lake County)
"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas. The palate runs sharp, with green apple controlling the flavor profile. Sudsy and monotone on the finish, with a bland, green-ish aftertaste.",Trapiche NV Extra Brut Sparkling (Mendoza)
"Chunky, dark and muddled, with flavors of cooked rhubarb and hard spice. Seems thick on the palate and pickled on the finish. Imported by Ecovalley Quality Wine Group and National Refrescos Import Company, LLC.",Tamaya 2007 Pink Goat Rosé (Limarí Valley)
"Undurraga has never been know for sparkling wines, and this brut isn't going to help much. It smells okay, with applesauce and lemon-lime stirring intrigue. But the palate and feel are off. It's foamy in the mouth, with undefined white-fruit flavors. Not ready for prime time.",Undurraga NV Brut  (Maipo Valley)
"Neither overpowering nor impressive. In fact, this is a flat, underdeveloped Torrontés with aromas of air freshener and flavors of banana, papaya and sugared doughnuts. It's not awful but it's the kind of wine that does nothing but fall apart once the cork is pulled.",Bodega Don Bosco 2007 Torrontés (Maipú)
"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.",Finca El Origen 2007 Gran Reserva Malbec (Uco Valley)
"This is the first Torrontés from Pascual Toso that we've rated, and if it's any indication of what's going on there, then we say stick to the reds. This is a borderline dud, with chunky, hollow flavors and a mealy finish. Not a total mess but not a good, vivacious Argentine Torrontes by any stretch.",Pascual Toso 2007 Torrontés (Maipú)
"Having liked the 2007 rosé from Los Vascos, this pickled, citric burner just doesn't cut it. It shows Sauvignon Blanc-like flavors and acidity, while the finish is sour and briney. Devoid of the charm and pleasantries that rosé should deliver.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2008 Los Vascos Rosé (Colchagua Valley)
"Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.",Signorello 2005 Padrone Proprietary Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)
"Fresh and perfumed, this wine has fine acidity along with bright berry flavors. The freshness suggests it is still young and needs to broaden out with its juicy, black currant aftertaste. In style it is dry, balance by a bright final acidity.",Cockburn's 2009 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Grapefruit and stony aromas grace the nose in front of a lightly spritzy palate. Flavors of mixed tropical fruits show notes of bell pepper and white pepper dust, while nectarine and grapefruit flavors drive the finish.",Cyatho 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Aromas of spring flowers and fresh orchard fruit lead the nose on this bright, fun sparkler. The palate doles out green apple, pear and citrus alongside zesty acidity and invigorating bubbles.",De Faveri 2014 GeG  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
Frothy fizz carries fresh lemon and lime scents to the surface. The palate has the same citric flavor profile and is diffuse with lots of bubbles—which exaggerates the lightness of the dry palate even more. While there is not a lot of substance there certainly is lots of refreshment.,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Tradition Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"The strawberry notes of this pink sparkler come with the flavor of cream soda. The fizz foams in a light, airy froth and makes the flavors dance on the dry, uncomplicated palate. This is fun and should be drunk as soon as possible.",Domaine François Schmitt NV Rosé Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Made with 100% Chardonnay, this sparkler opens with aromas of yellow apple, toasted nut and breadcrumb. The bright palate offers pear, citrus and walnut alongside small, vivacious bubbles.",Dorigo NV Blanc de Blancs Pas Dosé Metodo Classico Chardonnay (Vino Spumante)
"A rare grape in Oregon, this is a bright garnet shade and scented with cranberry and raspberry fruit. Acidity brings significant snap to the flavors, so much so that for many tasters it will show best with some greasy/smoky grilled meats. A hint of Band-Aid comes up in the finish, but does not distract.",Chehalem 2013 Ridgecrest Vineyards Gamay Noir (Ribbon Ridge)
"While labeled Extra Brut, this wine is on the sweeter side of this description. An attractive tang of lemon zest goes with the smooth creamed-apple flavors. The aftertaste is fresh and fruity, ready to drink.",Collet NV Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"Hints of oak smooth out the inherent herbal character of the grape, yielding ripe tones of apricot and pineapple. This wine is ripe and fruity and ready to drink.",Fiuza 2014 Premium Sauvignon Blanc (Tejo)
"Mumm's nonvintage cuvée is a soft Champagne, although now drier than in the past with attractive apple and pear flavors that are cut by citrus. It is lightly textured, hinting at almonds and with perfumed acidity at the end. This bottling is ready to drink.",G. H. Mumm NV Cordon Rouge Brut  (Champagne)
"This wine is bright, fruity and packed with berries and juicy black cherries. The acidity gives a fresh character that balances the sweetly ripe fruits. Ready to drink, this is a deliciously fruity wine.",Poças 2010 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port)
"Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach.",Pride Mountain 2013 Vintner Select Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Pale in color, this wine offers appealing, very varietal aromas of strawberry, cherry, sarsaparilla and coffee. It's quite elegant in style with strawberry and cinnamon flavors that show persistence.",Primarius 2013 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This one-barrel bottling is quite intriguing, offering unexpected aromas and flavors. An element of crunched grapeseeds and unfermented wine grapes mixes with licorice, olive and pepper on the nose. A similar sense pervades the palate, along with light coffee and brown tea flavors. It's slightly odd, but also an interesting change of pace.",Sanguis 2012 1/1 Syrah (Central Coast)
"Reserved aromatically, this wine from the longtime Santa Barbara producer shows bits of plum, hibiscus and graphite on the nose. The palate is surprisingly lush and punchy, with plum and other dark purple-fruit flavors as well as licorice.",Santa Barbara Winery 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"A 100% varietal Pinot, this wine has a faint bouquet of ripe black cherry and blackberry, exuding full flavor and body. Smooth, the oak is low impact, providing extra weight and sustenance while remaining balanced with the fruit.",Siduri 2013 Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)
"Clean, attractive aromas of fynbos and orange blossom add character to the fresh citrus and white melon core. The palate is light and vibrant, with pleasantly refreshing acidity and a subtly spiced pear-flavored finish. Enjoy now.",Simonsig 2014 Sunbird Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"A light, refreshing version of the variety from the heart of the Russian River, this traffics in medium-bodied peach and lime, ending with a sweetness of acidity.",Sonoma-Cutrer 2014 Winemaker's Release Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Peach and passion fruit aromas lead the way on this sparkler. The frothy palate shows tropical fruit, Granny Smith apple and kiwi alongside racy acidity and brisk, medium-sized bubbles that lend a fun vibe.",Il Follo 2014 Villa Luigia Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Billed as Extra Brut, the wine in fact tastes closer to the sweeter Brut because there is so much attractive apple and crisp pear fruitiness. The aftertaste is balanced, soft and creamy.",Jacquart NV Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"This opens with aromas of spring flowers, tropical fruit and a whiff of peach. The vibrant palate delivers creamy Granny Smith apple, underripe pear and a citrus note alongside bright acidity and a creamy mousse.",La Gioiosa NV Extra Dry  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"This opens with floral aromas of jasmine, wisteria and a whiff of exotic fruit. The off-dry palate doles out white peach, pineapple, Granny Smith apple and candied citrus zest, accompanied by a frothy mousse and bright acidity.",Villa Sandi NV Cuvée Oris  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"A grapy, meaty, feral nose is wild, floral and herbal as a whole. This blend of Tempranillo and other Rioja varieties is tannic along its walls. Saucy, grapy, salty flavors are powerful, while the finish is tannic, voluminous and once again grapy like the nose and palate.",Vivanco 2012 Colección Vivanco 4 Varietales Tempranillo-Graciano-Garnacha-Mazuelo  (Rioja)
"Tannins form a dark barrier to start this wine. It is still young, dense with chocolate as well as fruit flavors, showing the bitter, tough flavors that come from too much extraction. The fruit will hopefully come through and soften the tannins and bring out the richness. Drink from 2018.",Yohan Lardy 2014 Les Michelons  (Moulin-à-Vent)
"Pear and peach aromas lead the nose while the brisk palate offers lemon, lime, grapefruit and a mineral note. Zesty acidity and vigorous, persistent bubbles provide the racy framework.",Zardetto 2014 Viti di San Mor Brut  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"One of the more reliable, affordably priced Rhône blends in the state, this mix of 43% Grenache, 34% Syrah, 15% Mourvèdre and 8% Counoise offers slightly shy aromas of black and red licorice, red currant and cinnamon candy, tucked behind a layer of slate. The palate is more simplistic, with purple fruits most prevalent.",Beckmen 2012 Cuvee Le Bac Red (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Mild applesauce aromas are reticent but clean. This feels fresh, stony, acidic and narrow on the palate. Briny, citrusy flavors are more generic than particular, while the finish tastes like briny citrus, with an aftertaste of salty tang.",Bodegas Landaluce 2014 White (Rioja)
"This wine plays out broadly across the palate, showing tart berries and espresso components, along with a whiff of asparagus. The fruit is somewhat thin and front-loaded, with barrel flavors of toast and cigar box masking some—not all—of the herbaceousness.",Burrowing Owl 2011 Meritage (Okanagan Valley)
"Peach, pear, melon and vanilla aromas come with an aromatic sensation of wet rocks. Light and lifted on the palate, with honeydew, pear, lemon and stony flavors, this finishes fresh, clean and lightly powdery, with echoes of apple and pear.",François Lurton 2015 Piedra Negra Alta Colección Pinot Gris (Valle de Uco)
"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit.",Joullian 2014 Family Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Carmel Valley)
"Strawberry fruit is mixed in with fresh, pungent herbs—a mix that nicely expresses the Chehalem Mountains terroir. Fruity, full and forward, this ripe and pleasing wine is balanced just right for near-term enjoyment.",Torii Mor 2009 Hawks View Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)
"This wine is a great example of why Riesling is so increasingly popular. Despite the “dry” title on the label, it's actually a bit off-dry and crisp in acidity, with clean, savory flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, honey and vanilla. So easy to like, and the alcohol is relatively low.",V. Sattui 2010 Dry Riesling (Napa Valley)
"A light style, but still stylish, with finesse and good structure. The pretty plum fruit is lightly dusted with cocoa, softening the tannins and adding spice to the finish. A gentle and beguiling wine, ready for near-term enjoyment.",Hedgeline 2010 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"A blend of typical Alentejo grapes, this is a firm effort, with the fruit laced inbetween the complex tannic structure. The acidity gives the wine a final lift.",Herdade do Esporão 2010 4 Quatro Castas Red (Alentejano)
"Neutral up front except for green apple and mineral aromas. Feels quite good and healthy, with juicy acids pushing fresh bell pepper, lime and white peach flavors. Short but fresh and citrusy on the finish.",Chilcas 2011 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Dark, luscious and inky in appearance, Antrum shows thick and juicy aromas of jammy fruit, blackberry pie and rum cake. There are hints of dark spice and leather, with a touch of sour fruit and grittiness on the close.",Ciavolich Giuseppe 2005 Antrum  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"Bright and jammy red cherry, strawberry and raspberry aromas flood the nose of this Syrah-dominated blend, and carry onto the palate. Medium tannins add a bit of structure, while the finish is clean, with a mouthwatering sensation.",Clos des Augustins 2010 Les Bambins Red (Coteaux du Languedoc Pic Saint Loup)
"Minearally and fresh on the nose, with hints of grass, lime and apple. Good and round in the mouth, with ample acidic punch and lively flavors of nopal, citrus and tarragon. Mellow and just zesty enough on the finish.",Ventisquero 2011 Gran Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Appropriately named “Passion,” this hearty red wine expresses itself with opulence and generosity. Bold fruit layers of blackberry and cherry liqueur are framed by spice and chewy pipe tobacco. There's a ripe, syrupy feel in the mouth, with loads of jammy fruit on the close.",Vigne & Vini 2008 Passione  (Primitivo del Salento)
"Huge, ripe flavors of blackberry and plum jam, mocha, black currants, anise and cedar mark this wine, grown in the rugged hills of southern Monterey County. It's quite tannic and dry, but doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.",Indigené 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley)
"Rich, ripe and tropical, this calls to mind bananas soaked in cream. Round and lightly spicy, it's a forward, fruit-driven wine with a veneer of spice and toast, but enough acid to keep it lively.",King Estate 2010 Chardonnay (Oregon)
"In the hands of master blender Dirk Niepoort, even a straight tawny style has depth of flavor and intensity. The wine has red fruit, layered with concentrated acidity, a hint of wood aging, and remains fresh and fruity.",Niepoort NV Tawny  (Port)
"A blend of fruit from three different sites, united by their green farming practices, this is clean, fruity and forward. A mouth-pleasing Pinot with generously juicy and pretty cherry flavors.",Panther Creek 2008 Verde Vineyards Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"From the Canadian Okanagan, this stylish, well-balanced wine offers a focused mix of flavors—cola, cherry, tobacco and wet stone in particular. It's a fresh and lively palate, with the sort of crisp elegance found in some European Pinots.",Quails' Gate 2009 Pinot Noir (Okanagan Valley)
"A warm easygoing wine with aromas of black cherry, menthol and earth. On the palate, the flavors were less intense, and the mint and fruit character had not entirely resolved themselves. The finish, though, was solid and it would probably benefit from a couple of years of cellaring.",Palladino 2005 Bricco delle Olive  (Barbera d'Alba Superiore)
"There's still a sharpness to this wine, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It shows good blackberry, currant and chocolate-covered cherry flavors, but also a greener streak of mint and oregano that probably limits its ageability.",Altamura 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple cream, tangerine sorbet and buttered toast flavors. Made in a ripe, opulent California style.",William Hill Estate 2006 Estate Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"Lightweight, very herbal Sauvignon Blanc, full of green fruits, lemon zest and refreshing acidity. Ready to drink, it finishes as fresh as can be. Screwcap.",Guy Saget 2010 La Petite Perrière Sauvignon Blanc (Vin de France)
"Dominated by green-fruit aromas and also green veggies, for example bell pepper and asparagus. The body is pretty good and the acid level keeps it kicking, while the flavors run toward vegetal, just like the bouquet. Finishes with a final dose of green beans and capsicum. Seems to be fading.",Cono Sur 2009 Grapes Organically Grown Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
"This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.",Pinanfarina 2006 Vino Rosso Red (Napa Valley)
"A decent but clumsy wine, showing the pitfalls of this variety in California. It's very dry and silky in texture, but hot in alcohol, and there's a burnt taste to the cherry and oak flavors. Not going anywhere.",Longoria 2008 Clover Creek Vineyard Tempranillo (Santa Ynez Valley)
"An appealing nose of blackberry, plum and cinnamon gives this Lebanese red a sturdy start. Flavors of berry, spicebox and pepper follow, and balanced acids give it food friendly appeal. Not terribly complex, but definitely likeable.",Château Musar 2004 Cuvée Rouge Red (Bekaa Valley)
"This is a very pungent Sauvignon Blanc, aggressive in those green aromas and flavors generally lumped under the descriptive term of gooseberry. It's dry and clean and acidic, with a finish like the juice of Meyer lemons.",Geyser Peak 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Chardonnay has not been Silverado's strong suit in recent years and the tight, lean 2008 does not alter that conclusion. The wine is dry and acidic, with citrus and apple flavors that lack charm.",Silverado 2008 Chardonnay (Napa County)
"Green and vegetal in aromas and flavors. The nose deals pea, green bean and asparagus tempered by lime and melon. The palate has weight and a mix of green, grassy flavors as well as apple, lime and pineapple. A jalapeño-like burn is prominent on the finish. Definitely a cool-climate SB.",Anakena 2010 Indo Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
"The nose is pleasant, packed with peaches and a touch of cinnamon. On the palate the wine is quite intense but the finish given this intensity, is a little shorter than I would have expected.",Tosti NV Torlasco  (Moscato d'Asti)
"This new consumer-friendly brand sports a Garnacha-based rosado and a red blend. The rosé is a bit sweet and mass-market in style, but it has nice color, mouthfeel and integrity. With detectable residual sugar, it's probably better if you have previously enjoyed blush wines. Imported by Cellar Door.",Red Guitar 2006 Old Vine Garnacha Rosé (Navarra)
"Medium gold color. Pronounced aromas of candied citrus and stone fruit. Only moderate flavor intensity across the palate with dominant citrus notes and hints of pear and peach. Simple, and slightly one-dimensional with a warm, shortish finish.",Peter Weber 2007 Gewürztraminer (Alsace)
"A promising nose of blueberries, vanilla and spices. On the palate it was less exciting; the fruit was  muted, and there was not much else showing. The finish proved surprisingly long, and as the wine lay in the glass, it did show signs of improvement.",Gruppo Casaleone 2001 Rosa del Marchese  (Barbera d'Asti)
"A pleasant wine to drink, and a decent value. On the nose, it shows sweet, slightly roasted fruit, a touch of earth, but on the palate, although it begins well, the flavors disappears half way in, so there is little at the end and a thin finish.",Michele Chiarlo 2005 Le Orme  (Barbera d'Asti)
"One of the weakest wines in our group of 2003 Barolos from a producer whose wines are usually a lot better. It began with aromas of strawberry and dried cranberry. Quite thin on the palate, it showed some low level fruit, a good  deal of acid, and a long but slightly sour finish.",Tenimenti Ca' Bianca 2003  Barolo
"An austere wine that on the nose has little fruit although it has a slight  mineral component and a touch of weediness. On the palate, the mineral becomes more intense but that may be more due to the  absence of fruit. Slightly hollow in the mid palate, but the finish is surprisinly long.",Tosti NV Prosecco (Italy)
"The wine shows many of the characteristics of the vintage; slightly overripe and plummy, not much definition and plenty of alcohol. On the palate, there is plenty of raisiny fruit is at the front of the palate, but little else and the wine is hot and a little unbalanced, and there is slight bubblegum aftertaste.",Ca'Romè 2003 Vigna Cerretta  (Barolo)
"This was a difficult wine to taste. It was seriously extracted but it did not show a lot of fruit, and showed a slightly sweaty component. On the palate it was heavy and slightly coarse, but redeemed itself with a medium finish where some fruit came through.",Il Falchetto 2004 Lurëi  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Thin and tart, sharp citrus rind scents and flavors; then an unexpectedly sugary note in the finish.",Fujishin 2009 Bitner Vineyard Viognier
"A ripe, opulent wine, it's full of red berry and plum fruits layered with vanilla and spice. It is full in the mouth and generous. At the end, a fresher element shows through.",Domaine Terre de Mistral 2013 Rosalie Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"Tightly wound aromas of rubber and black fruits preview a rubbery, fruity palate that's generous in its delivery of vanilla, creamy berry, black plum and cassis flavors. A comfortable finish with mocha and smooth tannins confirms that this is a cleanly made, modern red wine.",Durigutti 2011 Reserva Cabernet Franc (Mendoza)
"Made with Fiano, one of Campania's most noble white grapes, this bright, balanced wine is loaded with citrus, exotic fruit, grapefruit, pastry cream, smoky mineral, almond and spice sensations. The lively acidity gives a clean, refreshing finish.",Fattoria La Rivolta 2012 Fiano (Sannio)
"Made with southern Italy's most noble white grape, this structured wine conveys subtle aromas of white and yellow spring flowers accented by whiffs of beeswax and slate. The juicy palate delivers white peach, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit and mineral alongside fresh acidity.",Feudi di San Gregorio 2012 Cutizzi  (Greco di Tufo)
"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers. Hints of tomato leaf garnish passion fruit and citrus flavors in this wine, which reveals a certain amount of austerity and restraint on the palate, a silky texture and a long, grapefruit-driven finish.",Fire Road 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 41% Syrah, 8% Petit Verdot and 6% Cabernet Franc, this blend has a rich nose of black cherry with strong touches of minerality. Flavors of black cherry, menthol, rose petal, violet and a whisper of clove are enmeshed in velvety tannins. The smooth finish is enhanced by a last-second dose of intense acidity.",Galil Mountain 2010 Alon Red (Upper Galilee)
Fragrances of peach and grapefruit set the scene for flavors of white peach and lemon peel with soft touches of menthol and a tangerine rind finish. This wine is smooth on the palate with a nice combination of creaminess and lemon-fresh acidity.,Golan Heights Winery 2012 Gilgal White Riesling (Galilee)
"Fresh apple and lime aromas are pure as can be. This is chiseled, crisp and crystalline in the mouth, with lime, grapefruit and other citrus flavors. A long, firm, flavorful finish brings a slight hint of citrus  pith the longer it runs out.",Montespina 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)
"Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020.",Novy 2011 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Luscious blackberry and cherry notes are marked with hints of bramble and spice in this bold yet elegantly framed wine. The palate feels lush and warm with judicious oak, yet bright, with a shower of cranberry acidity and fine-grain tannins that penetrate through the finish.",One Woman 2010 Estate Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"Made entirely of Fiano, this full-bodied white is loaded with white peach, lemon drop, sage, rosemary and mineral sensations. It's round and juicy and will continue to develop complexity over the next few years. Drink through 2017.",Planeta 2012 Cometa Fiano (Sicilia)
"As delicious and opulent as they come, yet it's somewhat formulaic. It's all about oak, insanely ripe black currant and dark chocolate fruit, ultrasmooth tannins and heat from alcohol.",Raymond 2009 District Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"Yellow peaches, waxy white florals and honeysuckle perfume this intensely aromatic wine. Floral notes persist on the palate as well, but are elegantly balanced with soft mineral tones and an invigorating lime acidity. Distinctly elegant, it finishes with a lingering hint of tea leaves.",Sheldrake Point 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This Cabernet-basred blend, with 13% Merlot, 4% Petit Verdot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec, opens with intense aromas of tobacco, leather, sweet smoke, cured meat, dried fig and fruit cake. Flavors of black berry, cherry and cassis unfold on the medium-weight palate, alongside firm, muscular tannins that hold on through the lingering finish. Drink now–2016.",Simonsig 2010 Tiara Red (Stellenbosch)
"Beautiful aromas lead the bouquet of this wine, a bright and fruity mix of tropical fruit, ripe pear, white melon, sweet orange and a touch of honeycomb. The well-balanced, medium-weight palate offers clean notes of melon, Anjou pear and clementine, followed by a clean, lightly spiced finish. Drink now–2016.",Simonsig 2012 Chenin Avec Chêne Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Floral notes of crushed violet and iris are partnered with fruity scents of boysenberry, black berry and cherry on the nose of this blend, made from 49% Merlot, 30% Malbec and 21% Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit continues on to the medium-weight palate, alongside spicy accents of pepper and licorice. The texture is full and the tannins mouthcoating yet fleeting on the finish. Drink now–2018.",Vilafonté 2010 Series M Red (Paarl)
"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",Vinyes del Terrer 2010 Terrer d'Aubert Red (Tarragona)
"Red fruits drive this tangy, fruity wine that is given shape by a more mineral texture. With dusty raspberry and plum flavors, it is shot through at the end with citrus.",Château Maupague 2013 Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"From a 100-acre estate formerly the home of the Counts of Provence, this wine has a great fruity character allied to a more mineral texture. With richness and vanilla flavors it is both packed with raspberry fruits and showing structure. Keep until the end of 2014.",Château Réal Martin 2013 Perle de Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Ripe apricot, mango and peach flavors mark this flashy Chardonnay. It's dry and oaky, with brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. Don't drink it too cold.",Corley Reserve 2012 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)
"It's bone dry, acidic and tannic in youth, but with a solid core of black cherries and red currants, and the oak has been subtlely applied. Give it until 2019–2020.",Cult X 2011 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A full-bodied, deliciously ripe blend of Pinot Blanc, Auxerrois and Pinot Noir, this is spiced with apples and crisp grapefruit acidity. Rich and creamy yet fresh, it is ready to drink.",Domaine Albert Mann 2010 Brut Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"This southern Rhone-style blend consists of 35% Mourvèdre, 40% Grenache and 25% Syrah. Steely minerality underscores pretty cherry fruit, with a light and peppery streak of herb running through the tannins.",Doyenne 2011 Métier Red (Red Mountain)
"The winery's most-available Syrah is co-fermented with a splash of Viognier. The fruit is tight and compact, clean with red and black berry flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins.",Doyenne 2011 Signature Syrah (Red Mountain)
"Ripe cherry and luscious watermelon aromas waft from this summery, fresh wine. It's dry on the palate but concentrated, with bright cherry and berry flavors. Round and lush yet briskly balanced, it's a great summer quaffer at a fantastic price.",Dr. Konstantin Frank 2013 Dry Rosé Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes)
"Rich and velvety, it carries an important mouthfeel consisting of firm tannins, good acidity and a firm, minerally grounding. Fruit is the star, filling the mouth with blackberries and black currants, and a smoky coating of oak. With a dry finish, it's drinking very well now, and will soften through 2018.",Emblem 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Initially, this comes across as being baked out and tired, but give it time to spread out and it reveals mature, earthy, leafy aromas and a round palate with choppy, firm tannins. Earthy flavors of dried cherry, Christmas spices and chocolate yield to licorice on the finish. Drink now.",Ferré I Catasús 2008 Terra de Fic 2 Red (Priorat)
"The blend is Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. The wine remains tough, dry and scoury at the age of 11 years, showing its yeastiness and subtle flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. It's elegant, but probably not going anywhere, so drink up. Sushi will be an ideal companion.",Gloria Ferrer 2003 Carneros Cuvée Sparkling (Carneros)
"Long-time Cloudy Bay winemaker Kevin Judd has been out on his own for several vintages, and this is a fine effort. The characteristic herbal, grassy elements of Marlborough are present, but toned-down, making this wine an easier fit with a variety of foodstuffs. A pleasant plumpness to the mouthfeel turns dry and chalky on the long finish.",Greywacke 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Plum and especially blueberry fruit compels your interest immediately. It's cloaked in precisely focused tannins that frame an extended, lightly chocolaty finish.",Novelty Hill 2011 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Aged entirely in stainless steel tanks, this carries a light touch (7 g/L) of residual sugar but remains sharp, even edgy, with bright acidity and pine needle highlights. Ripe apple and pineapple flavors carry through the clean and refreshing finish.",Chehalem 2016 INOX Unoaked Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)

The two elements balance and will allow this wine to age well. Drink from late 2017 or even early 2018.,Château Tour de Mirambeau 2016 Réserve  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"This is a ripe and soft blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon. Well balanced, it has rich, spicy fruit lifted by lemon and apple flavors and by the final acidity. It's ready to drink now.",Château Vircoulon 2016  Bordeaux Blanc
"A nice debut from this new label under the Tendril umbrella. Intense in color and deep in flavor, this pure varietal rosé pushes forward raspberry and cherry fruit with plenty of juicy pizzazz. The back end revs up with a burst of citrus rind.",Child's Play 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Ripe aromatic peach notes dominate the nose. The palate brings this out in much fuller force, helped along by a dollop of residual sweetness and balanced by a pleasantly bitter zesty phenolic edge. The off-dry flavors are generous while the body is balanced and rounded.",Domaine Charles Frey 2016 Collines de Granit Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Aged, like so many Loire sparkling wines, in the caves of Saumur, this is a rich wine. It has a nutty charm as well as ripe apple and white stone-fruit flavors. Its acidity is finely integrated giving a smooth wine. It is ready to drink.",Domaine du Petit Clocher NV Brut  (Crémant de Loire)
"A gentle hint of restrained citrus freshness appears on the nose. The same restrained but wonderfully pure citrus flavor also characterizes the slender, light and dry palate: it's a mix of fresh lemon and aromatic, tangy tangerine peel. This enlivens and refreshes and has a totally uplifting lemony finish.",Domaine Gérard Neumeyer 2016 Les Hospices Riesling (Alsace)
"The nose is a little subdued. The palate comes in with a creamy poised richness that holds ripe peach, rose petal and grapefruit zest. There is a pleasant streak of bitterness that channels the richness of the concentrated fruit. The finish is just off dry, clean and zesty.",Domaine Pfister 2015 Tradition Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"The winery has had some success with this Spanish variety, but the '05 is not one of their best efforts. The wine is thinly structured and harsh in tannins, with exaggerratedly sweet cherry, cola and currant flavors.",Martin & Weyrich 2005 Flamenco Rojo Tempranillo (Paso Robles)
"Made in the sweet, sugary style that many consumers like, this is almost like an off-dry dessert wine. Tastes like a citrus and peach power drink, with alcohol.",Montevina 2006 Pinot Grigio (Amador County)
"Kind of Pinot Noir-like, with a silky texture, crisp acids and cherry and spice flavors. But it's rustic and simple, with a soft, gluey mouthfeel.",Esser Cellars 2006 Pinot Noir (California)
"Somewhat lean, this has a tart, grapefruit character that sits awkwardly with the otherwise fresh, green fruit character. Hard-edged.",Quinta do Casal Branco 2006 Terra de Lobos White (Ribatejano)
"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate. The orange marmalade and honey flavors are over the top and sticky, while the wine leaves an unctuous, resinous finish. Too much of this 15% Moscatel could cause a headache.",Señorío de Sarria 2005 Vino Dulce Natural Moscatel (Navarra)
"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges.",Lucas Vineyards 2005 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Soft and thick in the mouth, even heavy, with ripe pie-filling flavors of blackberries and cherries that finish sweet.",Cinnabar 2004 Cabernet Franc (Lodi)
"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",Standing Stone 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
Ketchup aromas are pungent and a bit overwhelming. It's too bad because the wine tastes good thanks to its firm structure.,Tenuta Sette Ponti 2005 Vigna di Pallino Sangiovese (Toscana)
"The familiar rosé Lancers is all about crushed strawberries with a touch of sugar. There is a light structure, but the attractive light pink color and the fresh fruit all work together. Screwcap.",José Maria da Fonseca NV Lancers Rosé Red (Table wine)
"Thin and light. Solid flavors of red cherry and berry jam lead into a short but lively finish. With virtually no tannins, this is a suitable choice for lighter chicken or fish dishes.",Kadesh Barnea 2004 Estate Bottled Reserve Kosher Merlot (Negev Hills)
"Lacking intensity, the nose exhibits mild notes of ripe red apple while the palate adds a touch of canteloupe. Fat and round with a fleeting finish, the wine never really makes a strong impression.",Fortant 2005 Kosher Chardonnay (Vin de Pays d'Oc)
"Though a touch green on the nose, that's countered by plenty of wood and vanilla. Hints of plum, faded cherry and licorice appear in the mouth, with a sweet, cedary finish. Drink now.",Barkan 2005 16 Months Barrel Aged Kosher Tempranillo (Samson)
"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine. This is a funky, earthy specimen with burnt notes and a grassy aftertaste.",Valsanzo 2005 Vall Sanzo  (Ribera del Duero)
"Sharp and medicinal, with the taste of plastic bandages and cherry-mint candies; very tannic.",Wellington 2004 Mohrhardt Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Subtle aromas of cherry and cinnamon spice are followed by an overly tart, acidic character on this wine from historic Brotherhood. Light and somewhat one dimensional, it does have a clean finish and its minerality will recommend it to food pairing.",Brotherhood 2005 Pinot Noir (New York)
"There's a lack of balance, with thin, slightly bitter fruit overriding any complexity that may have been achieved with more oak. This is not offensive, it just lacks character.",Damiani 2006 Chardonnay (Finger Lakes)
"Something went south on this Cabernet-Syrah blend, and the problem probably was the Cab, because the winery's regular Syrah is really good. This wine is sharp and vinegary, with sweet and sour cherry flavors.",La Capilla 2005 Melange Red (Paso Robles)
"Sweet and simple, with jellied blackberry and cherry flavors, harsh tannins and a sugary finish.",Esser Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (California)
"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",Eleusis 2006 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Too sweet by far for a table wine, with simple, medicinal cherry and blackberry flavors and a harshly tannic mouthfeel.",Esser Cellars 2005 Zinfandel (California)
"Excessively ripe fruit verging on baked, burnt blackberries, hard tannins and residual sweetness.",Vina Robles 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called “meditation wine.”",Avignonesi 1995 Occhio di Pernice  (Vin Santo di Montepulciano)
"This is a great 2005 Pinot Noir, the best ever from Talley. The wine somehow combines huge ripe fruit with delicacy. It floods the mouth with profound currant, cherry pie, licorice, cola, raspberry, cocoa and vanilla smoke flavors, yet feels light and silky, and is thoroughly dry. That's the magic of Pinot Noir. You can enjoy this small production wine now, and it should develop additional complexities for 10 years.",Talley 2005 Rosemary's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley)
"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex. The tannins are most pronounced on the finish and need time to further integrate, but make the wine long-lasting in leathery cassis and tobacco flavor.",Occasio 2010 Thatcher Bay Vineyard Merlot (Livermore Valley)
"Inky black in color, with hard tannins, this Petite Sirah is drinkable now only because it's so soft in acidity and fruity. The candied black raspberry and cherry flavors have interesting notes of cloves, leather, violets and green herbs. The perfect food accompaniment will be grilled beef.",Peachy Canyon 2011 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"From a high-elevation vineyard on the eastern edge of Lake County, this Cabernet offers sensuously juicy, brambly fruit and a dusty backbone. Rich and chewy, it conveys intense cranberry, black cherry and woodsy cedar.",Langtry 2010 Tephra Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"Pear-scented, this supple white delivers straight down the line without any annoying frills. The wine is balanced, clean and comes with poised acidity.",Leth 2012 Steinagrund Grüner Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
"Melon, peach, leesy vanilla and mineral aromas are what you want from this type of wine. The palate is juicy and fresh, with nectarine, orange and pineapple flavors. A racy finish is confirmation of this Albariño's zesty character.",Maior de Mendoza 2012 Argos Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"The excellent Olsen vineyards provided the fruit for this pure Malbec. It's still quite young, showing clean and tightly-wound flavors. Berry and cherry fruit highlights the palate, with a light hint of chocolate woven through the finish.",Market Vineyards 2010 Merval Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Fragrances recall wet leaves, underbrush, forest berries and baking spices with a touch of espresso. The palate reveals black cherry accented with black pepper and espresso alongside bracing, tongue-drying tannins. This is a big wine, but the fruit isn't quite rich enough to support the evident alcohol.",Mastrojanni 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"A solid effort, in the mainstream style that you'll find on many restaurant-chain wine lists. Apricot jelly—not jam—flavors carry through all the way, with a clean, crisp, well-balanced finish. The residual sugar is just under 30 g/L.",Pacific Rim 2012 Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A brawny wine, it leads with ripe berry, underbrush, toast and leather aromas. The juicy palate offers sweet wild cherry and black raspberry accented with notes of mint, thyme, black pepper and hint of coffee alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2015–2021.",Palazzo 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Robust black-fruit aromas suggest plum and blackberry. This everyday red is concentrated, generous and packed with power. Flavors of dark berry fruits, chocolate and espresso finish with verve and clarity.",Paso a Paso 2012 Estate Bottled Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"A quirky blend of six wildly-different white grapes, this has some sweet fruit, some bitter phenolics, and a noticeable honeyed character, suggesting that there was some botrytis in the mix. Rich and loaded with flavors of lemon curd, apricot and ripe peaches, it's a creative, interesting wine, worth exploring at this price.",Patterson 2012 Forbidden White (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This forward wine opens with aromas that recall mature black plum, grilled herbs and meat juices with whiffs of farmyard and leather. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, sweet vanilla extract and round tannins. Even though it lacks complexity, it's enjoyable drinking for the near term. Drink through 2019.",Piccini 2009 Villa al Cortile  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"It shows earthy aromas of wet soil and leafy underbrush, as well as leather, dark berry and spice. The palate offers restrained black plum, sour cherry, espresso and licorice alongside firm yet drying tannins. The fruit richness is starting to fade so enjoy soon rather than later.",Pietroso 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"Dry and medium-bodied, this Pinot has nice raspberry, cherry and persimmon flavors, as well as brisk acidity. Toasted oak shows up as smoky, brown butter sauce. The earthiness suggests pairing with a rich risotto of butternut squash or wild mushrooms.",Poseidon 2012 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"An aromatic wine with notes of ripe nectarine, honey and jasmine. It's medium sweet with an assortment of dried apricot flavors that display a pleasing sense of balance that continues through the lingering finish.",Radius 2012 Riesling (Washington)
"Balsam, menthol, spice and black and red berry aromas with hints of mint lead the nose on this wine. The palate offers subtle red cherry, prune, tea and tobacco alongside velvety but rather fleeting tannins. It closes on a drying, astringent note.",San Giacomo 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"One of the few varietal bottlings produced in the state, this concrete-fermented wine brings notes of straw, wet stone, herbs and citrus zest. It's tart and mouthwatering with lemony acidity and a textured feel, screaming out for shellfish to be served alongside it.",Syncline 2012 Underwood Mountain Vineyard Grüner Veltliner (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.",Trapiche 2012 Oak Cask Malbec (Mendoza)
"Merlot heavily dominates this Right Bank-style wine, with Cabernet Sauvignon accounting for only 11% of the blend. That accounts for the softness and the domination of cherries, red currants and violets. The acidity is mouthwatering. It's an easy-drinking wine, with some aspirations to complexity.",Cameron Hughes 2012 Lot 426 Red Hen Ranch Meritage (Oak Knoll District)
"In this still very young wine, the tannins dominate, but the fruitiness is there to come out later. With power, black fruits and touches of dark chocolate, it will be a fine, rich wine. Drink from 2017.",Château Bibian 2011  Haut-Médoc
"A year's wood aging has left its mark on this wine in the form of burnt smokiness. However, the fruit is rich and full-bodied giving the promise that the wine will smooth out its rough edges. There already is a fine juiciness at the end that comes with great acidity.",Château Cap Léon Veyrin 2011  Listrac-Médoc
"A wood-laden wine, it still manages to bring out its inherent fruitiness. It's a ripe wine, showing spice from the wood and juicy blackberry flavors, well packaged and finished off with acidity. Drink this attractive wine from 2016.",Château de Braude 2011  Haut-Médoc
"This Syrah emphasizes herb and spice, keeping the peppery fruit in the background. Nice grip and a pleasing texture contribute to the enjoyment, though the light, grapy flavors make you wonder how well the wine will age.",Helix by Reininger 2010 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Honey and almond notes lend a nutty earthiness to lifted citrus aromas. It's concentrated with sweet tangerine flavor, and has a sharp, zesty acidity that drives a moderately long finish.",Heron Hill 2010 Bunch Select Late Harvest Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"This plump Brunello offers layered aromas of black plum, mature berry, vanilla, and balsamic notes with a hint of leather. The ripe, one-dimensional palate first reveals rich, sweet black cherry, black pepper and cocoa but concludes rather abruptly with a drying finish.",Il Poggiolo 2009 Annata  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"This wine opens with animal and farmyard aromas that aren't unpleasant and which burn off in the glass to reveal mature black fruit and leather. The sweet palate offers fleshy, almost overripe blackberry, black cherry, cinnamon-spice and balsamic herbs. It finishes on an astringent note of wood tannins.",La Rasina 2009  Brunello di Montalcino
"This shows stalky, corny notes on the nose along with mineral and white-fruit scents. There's a lemony quality to an otherwise neutral palate, while saline, lemon and mild but increasing bitterness control the flavor profile and finish.",Zarate 2012 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"This is a big, ripe rosé, with lush red cherry, rosehip tea, apricot and vanilla flavors. It has zesty acidity and a silky mouthfeel. Some fruity sweetness lingers in the finish, but the wine is essentially dry.",Del Dotto 2012 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir Rosé (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"Sourced entirely from the Artz vineyard, this Sauvignon Blanc is quite fruity, concentrated, slightly sweet, and drinking optimally. Flavors of melon and citrus carry on through a lush, well-rounded finish.",Eleven 2012 La Donella Sauvignon Blanc (Washington)
"This Bordeaux-style blend is a mix of Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot, tart and falling on the thin side. Wild raspberry fruit is accented with scents and flavors of earth and hay. It's aromatic, astringent, and well-suited for grilled meats.",Elsom Cellars 2009 Autonomous Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This seemingly forward Hermitage boasts bold notes of lime, pineapple and melon, wrapped in a soft blanket of toastiness and restrained oak. It's round in the mouth and ample in body, with a long finish faintly suggestive of coffee. Drink now.",Fayolle Fils & Fille 2009 Les Dionnières White (Hermitage)
"Lush, composed and fresh on the bouquet, with blackberry and perfect prune aromas. This is mouthfilling and smooth, with a firm, flush tannic structure and flavors of coconut, lemon rind, herbal black fruit and red berry. It's long and supple late, and it's arguably one of the best Cabernet Sauvignons you'll find from Spain and Navarra.",Finca Albret 2007 La Viña de Mi Madre Reserva Red (Navarra)
"This Sémillon-Sauvignon Blanc blend is firm, powerful and polished. The fruit runs the gamut from citrus to melon to white peach, finishing with some youthful bite. Already a succulent, mouthfilling gem, but should improve for another five years.",Insania 2010 White (Red Mountain)
"This oaked Chenin shows great structure and power now, with the potential to cellar nicely for another three years or beyond. Toasted brioche, wood-grilled peaches and quince aromas open up immediately on the bouquet and carry through to the palate alongside seductive accents of sweet spice, almond skin and orange oil. The texture is round and full, and the spice-driven finish is long and satisfying.",Jean Daneel 2010 Signature Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"This Merlot starts off tough and tannic, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants and toasty oak, girded with minerals and spices and finishing totally dry. It feels elegant and balanced, showing a fine sense of control. Drink over the next 5–6 years.",Kendall-Jackson 2009 Grand Reserve Merlot (Sonoma County)
"Expensive, yes, but very fine, especially if you're looking for a Chardonnay that's drier, more elegant and more streamlined than the opulent, buttery modern style. Sleek and crisp in acidity, this features citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, with a balanced addition of smoky oak.",La Rochelle 2010 Rosella's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A very rich Chardonnay that's creamy and smooth in the mouth. A touch of oak and lees gives weight and density to the lime and peach fruit, while brisk acidity contributes brightness. A great price for a wine of this distinction.",Kendall-Jackson 2010 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara-Monterey)
"This has memorable aromas of warm hat, green herbs and perfumed fruit candy. It is a delicious wine that has been aged in cask before bottling.",Kirchmayr 1992 Solist Riesling (Kamptal)
"This shows the chilly vintage in the bright acidity that makes this wine's finish so zesty clean. The flavors are tantalizing, suggesting golden apricots, limes and honey, but are complex in minerals and creamy in lees, making it an intellectual wine.",Lynmar 2010 La Sereinité Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Pretty rich and full-bodied for Pinot Noir, this is a big wine that grabs your attention. It floods the mouth with flavors of sour cherry candy and spicy persimmons, with a rich overlay of toasty oak and exotic spices. The acidity lends a nice bite. It's too young to appreciate now, but it should gain traction after 2014.",Maggy Hawk 2009 Unforgettable Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Shows Pride's house style, a wildly bold, mountain-concentrated wine that couldn't possibly be fruitier or riper. Intense flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cedar are wrapped into complex but gentle tannins, making the wine drinkable now. But it should develop over the next 6–8 years.",Pride Mountain 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa-Sonoma)
"Delicious and full bodied, this has both weight and delicacy. It is rich and dry, with swathes of ripe apricot and pineapple that cut through the tense acidity. A wine for aging over 5–6 years. Screwcap.",Rabl 2010 Schenkenbichl Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"A stunning and inviting dessert wine that exhibits the superb balance that Chenin Blanc can lend to the style. Honeyed peach and apricot notes abound, with spicy accents of ginger, clove-spiked orange and toast. The mouth is lush and slightly viscous, but the racy acidity provides good cut. This ends with a long, spice-driven finish. Delicious now, but it should age for another five years.",Ken Forrester 2009 T Noble Late Harvest Chenin Blanc (Stellenbosch)
"Bold as always, with a ton of cedar, graphite, blackberry, vanilla and coconut notes on the nose. This is huge, tough and ripe, with massive blackberry, café mocha and vanilla flavors. It finishes hard but with a cascade of sweet fruit, marshmallow, coconut cake, herb and vanilla. Needs a few more years to settle. Drink after 2013.",Maurodos 2007 San Román  (Toro)
"This cool-climate Riesling, technically off-dry with 2% residual sugar, has very tart, highly extracted flavors, with flavors including tangy citrus, peach, apricot and papaya. The length, acidity, texture, mouthfeel, depth and surpassing freshness are exceptional.",AntoLin Cellars 2010 Glacier Estate Vineyard Riesling (Yakima Valley)
"With low alcohol and a clean minerality, this Pinot represents the new direction that the variety is taking in California, helped by cooler vintages. It's dry, crisply acidic and complex, with the cherry-berry flavors assisted with notes of earthy herb and mushroom. A lovely wine now, and should gently develop over the next six years.",Babcock 2010 Slice of Heaven Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This is the winery's best Marinus since 2007, and is as good as the '04—which is arguably the best ever. It offers immediate pleasure, with soft tannins and acids framing perfectly ripened blackberry, cherry, cola and earthy flavors. Ready to drink now.",Bernardus 2009 Marinus Red Wine Red (Carmel Valley)
"This is the second of Black Kite's 2009 Pinot Noirs to be released, following the Redwood's Edge last year. It's an impressive wine, dry, richly textured and crisp, showing complex cherry compote, chocolate-covered mint, spice and sandalwood flavors. It's clearly delicious, but gains extra charm from the smooth texture and elegance. Drink now-2015.",Black Kite 2009 Angel Hawk Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"With its Mourvèdre content, this is a big-hearted wine. It is finely balanced between its rich yellow and red fruits and spice and acidity. This is a great food rosé, textured and ripe.",Domaines Ott 2011 Château de Romassan Rosé (Bandol)
"Classic Petite Sirah, in the full-bodied richness, dryness, hard tannins and deep flavors of ripe dark berries and fruits, cocoa, grilled meat and black pepper. As good as that is, it also shows the impeccable balance of a fine Napa Valley red wine. Good now with robust meat stews and roasts, and it should develop for many years.",Elyse 2010 Barrel Select Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"The 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now–2020.",Clarendon Hills 2008 Brookman Syrah (Clarendon)
"This is a top-notch effort—a blend of 80% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 5% Mourvèdre. It starts off with intriguing floral and herbal notes, then delivers deep black-cherry flavors on the palate, tinged with savory nuances of roasted meat and black olive. It's full bodied and round, richly but finely textured and very drinkable now yet with the substance to age up to 10 years or more.",Domaine du Grand Montmirail 2009 Cuvée Vieilles Vignes  (Gigondas)
"This is a tight, black-fruited wine, with generous flavors that include espresso and licorice. At first it's quite firm and a bit unyielding, it slowly peels open layer after layer, tossing out hints of dried herb, tobacco and mocha.",Walla Walla Vintners 2009 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a sophisticated blend of Carignano, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and it's always delightful. This vintage shows intense, soft notes of dried sage and rosemary.",Agricola Punica 2008 Barrua Red (Isola dei Nuraghi)
"A winner given its quality-to-price quotient. This smells earthy, dark and harmonious, with black plum and berry aromas leading the charge. It feels racy, juicy and full, with giant raspberry, plum, vanilla, tobacco and licorice flavors. It's textured on the finish, with bright, lasting flavors. Drink now.",Cellers Sant Rafel 2005 Solpost Red (Montsant)
"Cabernet Franc is a difficult variety on its own, but Jarvis does an excellent job. This is still quite tannic, with a hard, astringent mouthfeel to the cherry, blackberry and dark-chocolate flavors. Give this a few more years of aging, although it doesn't seem like a longterm ager.",Jarvis 2007 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"The vintage was cool, lending this wine strong acidity that cuts through the mouth like a squirt of lime juice. Dry and austere, it offers oak-influenced sour-cherry candy and cola flavors. This should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–6 years.",Lynmar 2010 Freestone Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"One of the best California rosés of the last several years. It's light bodied, crisply acidic, and ultrarefined, with flavors of polished rose, herbal tea, strawberry and spice. So clean and so pure, this is wonderfully dry on the finish.",Lynmar 2011 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a lovely, sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc, with rich aromas of candied fruit, apricot, honeysuckle and amazing aromatic intensity. Thick, creamy and enduring on the palate, this beautiful wine shows the structure for long cellar aging.",Cantina Terlano 2010 Quarz Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"Here's an exuberant, country-style Zin that's easy to drink with barbecue. It's enormously fruity in blackberries, currants, mulberries and cinnamon-spicy mocha, with firm tannins that need rich meats to unlock. Drink soon.",Sobon Estate 2006 Rezerve Zinfandel (Amador County)
"Rich, soft and spicy, this is a warm, ripe wine. With its flavors of figs, black plums and herbs, it certainly sums up the heat of the Douro, leaving some good fresh acidity to finish.",Sogevinus 2006 Curva Tinto Red (Douro)
"Plenty of smoky, spicy oak on this Chard, along with ripe, orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. It's a little rough around the edges, though. Drink now.",Testarossa 2007 Castello Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"This Zinfandel is bone-dry and classically varietal, with briary, wild berry, black currant, mocha, raisin and peppery spice flavors. But consumers should understand that the alcohol is 16.7%. It's a great example of a superripe Sonoma Zin, but be careful to not drink too much.",Valdez 2005 Rockpile Road Vineyard Zinfandel (Rockpile)
"Rich and exotic, this Zin offers a blast of ripe wild blackberry, briary currants, mulberry, mocha, pepper and spice flavors that are wrapped into sturdy tannins. It's a strongly flavored wine that needs powerful fare to match it.",XYZin 2006 Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"A Bordeaux blend made from this high plateau between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Tastes rugged and immature, with bright blackberry, currant and cedar flavors wrapped into tough tannins. Too powerful now. Try after 2010.",Elements of Sonoma 2004 E3 Red (Knights Valley)
"Almost overripe, with oak-inspired currant and plum flavors that veer into raisins. But the wine is bone-dry and soft, with mellowing notes of chocolate. Finishes in a swirl of peppery spice.",Forchini 2006 Proprietor's Reserve Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"With its vanilla buttercream and spicy, smoky overtones, this Chard also shows underlying fruit flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and green apples. It's a crisp, supple young wine, and this is a good price to pay.",Gallo Family Vineyards 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.",Gary Farrell 2004 Encounter Red (Sonoma County)
"An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics.",Marc Kreydenweiss 2005 Au Dessus de la Loi Andlau Riesling (Alsace)
"Here's a light, spicy, pretty red wine, mixing juicy and sweet plum and purple grape flavors with plenty of acid. You might pick up hints of tobacco, a little white pepper; the acids keep the wine fresh and the fruit is youthful and vibrant.",Abacela 2006 Umpqua Cuvée Tempranillo (Southern Oregon)
"Surely there is no other Syrah-Tempranillo-Merlot-Dolcetto-Graciano-Petit Verdot-Nebbiolo-Cabernet Franc-Grenache-Muscat-Viognier-Tannat-Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon in the world? What's it taste like? Well, red table wine is as good a description as can be offered. Racy red fruits, mineral, bitter chocolate, good grip, spicy tannins—bring on the burgers.",Abacela NV Vintner's Blend #9 Red Table Wine Red (Southern Oregon)
"A blended style of Madeira, this is rich, soft, without the ineffable bite of a wine made from the classic varieties, but certainly with acidity and wood as well as a full, caramel-flavored aftertaste.",Blandy's NV Duke of Clarence Rich Madeira (Madeira)
"Sharp and tannic, with cherry, blackberry, coffee, cocoa and peppery flavors. Exuberantly rustic now, but could mellow with a year or two in the bottle.",Buena Vista 2005 Merlot (Carneros)
"High acidity gives this wine its mouth-tingling, almost sour taste, but oodles of cherries balance it. It's also pretty tannic. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink with meats in rich tomato sauce, garlic and cheese.",Ca' del Solo 2006 Dolcetto (Monterey County)
This inexpensive Pinot Gris has pear fruit with spicy highlights that somehow conjure up caraway. It's wrapped in yeasty flavors of fresh-baked bread and plenty of lemony acid.,Cloudline 2007 Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"For a wine at this price, this is an impressive performance. It is rich, finely structured, the juicy blackberry flavors filling the mouth. It may lack complexity, but the spice, tobacco and berry flavors are enjoyably drinkable.",Dão Sul 2006 Cortello Touriga Nacional (Estremadura)
"A good Cabernet, if a little gritty, with herb-infused flavors of black currants, plums and spices. Might soften with a few years in the bottle, but not really a longterm ager.",Francis Ford Coppola 2006 Director's Cut Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Honey, flower and melon leads on this delicate Riesling from Hazlitt. Juicy, full flavors of melon and citrus are balanced with a crisp minerality that lingers in the finish. Complex and energetic.",Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Finger Lakes)
"The Macari No 1 offers an aromatic nose of grapefruit and tropical fruit, followed by crisp citrus and mineral flavors. The wine is balanced and refreshing, but has complexity. Pair with Thai or Indian dishes.",Macari 2007 No 1 Sauvignon Blanc (North Fork of Long Island)
"Bramble and brine are present on the nose, and while 2005 was a very good vintage in Rioja, this wine brings a little less than expected. It's endowed with snappy red-fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, and there's also vanilla and herbal notes. The feel is dry, medium-bodied and grabby, with a hint of stemmy snap.",Marqués de Cáceres 2005 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Those who seek out Gewürztraminer for its intense, exotic nose will want to look elsewhere. Despite the subtle aromatic profile, the rich palate is bursting with flavors of rose water, spice and cloves. It finishes fairly dry, with just a hint of residual sugar.",Pierre Sparr 2006 Reserve Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Dry and softly tannic, this is a nice Cab to drink now with steaks and chops. It has herb-infused flavors of black currants and cherries, with a spicy edge.",Trentadue 2005 Geyserville Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"A touch of volatility accompanies opening black fruit and plum aromas, while the palate brings both a raisiny essence and austere acidity that causes tartness. For basic Priorat, this is fine. But if you're looking for greatness, there isn't much to speak of. Overall, it's a good but regular wine, nothing more or less.",Scala Dei 2006 Negre Red (Priorat)
"Soft berry and pepper spice aromas give this elegant red a mellow start. On the palate, savory meat and cherry flavors are touched with an herbal lift. Smooth and delicate in nature, and a pretty sipping wine.",Koenig Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Merlot
"Creamy and fruity, this Viognier has forward flavors of pineapples, limes, ripe green apples, vanilla, honey and cinnamon spice, balanced with crisp acidity, and totally dry on the finish. It's an easy, enjoyable wine.",Meadowcroft 2007 Viognier (Sonoma County)
"Attractive aromas of mineral and slate are hampered by some musty notes. Nonetheless, the palate is well-structured, with refreshing acidity reinforcing mineral notes. This is an austere, dry style perfect for those who shy away from the fruitier examples.",Domaines Schlumberger 2006 Les Princes Abbés Riesling (Alsace)
"Mature fruit is veneered with oak and kissed with dusty cocoa and dry earth. Although this is losing freshness, it comes off as elegant and the tannins suggest that it may age for just a year or two longer.",Plaisir De Merle 1998 Merlot (Paarl)
"A tart, flinty and apple-y rendition of Riesling, one that's lean and light, one that leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh after swallowing or spitting. One that would make a particularly pleasant aperitif.",Elk Cove 2001 Riesling (Willamette Valley)
"Light and fresh, with hints of peach, citrus, melon, spice and slate. The wine serves up a refreshing mix for spring and summertime sipping. Fruity on the finish. -J.M.",Firestone 2002 Riesling (Central Coast)
"Approachable, fresh flavors of red plum, toast, tobacco and apple peels finish with a cedary zing. The body of this wine is lightweight, with good acids and particulate tannins with a fair grip.",Havana Hills 1999 Shiraz (Western Cape)
"Bright, fresh, fruity and light bodied, with pretty peach, apple and spice flavors that leave a crisp, clean and pleasant finish. Fairly sweet, but refreshing.",J. Lohr 2002 Bay Mist Riesling (Monterey)
"Damp, foresty earth aromas meet those of cherry and dusty cocoa, which carry to the palate of lightweight red fruit. The balance of smooth tannins and gentle acidity is pleasant, but there is room for more heft and complexity overall in this wine.",Thelema 1999 Merlot (Stellenbosch)
"This wine has a thin streak of eucalyptus throughout. As a foil to that green note, there is red licorice, cassis, sweet cherry and blk plum to entice. Pleasant notes of molasses, oiled leather and white pepper round out the palate.",Mas Nicolas 2000 Cape Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"A nice Cabernet, proper and pleasant, it tastes of blackcurrants and oak and is very dry and balanced. No doubting that it comes from a good vineyard and has been made in a competent style.",Mendocino Gold 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendocino County)
"A well-balanced and straightforward wine, the Tintara is medium-bodied and creamy in the mouth, with stone fruit and vanilla flavors. Butterscotch, and maybe some nuttiness, wraps it up on the finish.",Hardys 2001 Tintara Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"This funky white blend, now in its 6th rendition, carries no vintage or regional designation, but we know it's a blend of several white grapes grown mostly in Oregon. The nose is ripe and full of melon, while the spunky palate deals orange and lemon, but not in sour-ball fashion. The finish has some thickness and a slight sticky feel, but ample acidity throughout renders it a good, brisk drink.",Sokol Blosser NV Evolution 6th Edition White (Oregon)
"Rustic and funky, with a curious nose sending up scents of fruit, musk, soy, pepper and espresso. Flavors are vivid and grapey, and there is a penetrating spicy note running throughout. The finish is tannic and rough.",Abacela 2000 Cabernet Franc (Oregon)
"This wine seems to reach out to the mainstream: flavors and aromas of sweet vanilla, cinnamon toast and brown sugar are met with lightweight red fruit, a soft balance and just a touch of white pepper. Inoffensive on all counts, but lacks the depth needed to set it apart.",New World 2002 Syrah (Western Cape)
"The balance of this wine has slightly spritzy acidity in the lead, wrapped with sheer tannins. Rich aromas of earth, leather and toast are contrasted by the bright fruit which is a sweet candylike strawberry-cherry at the forepalate.",Niel Joubert 2000 African Tradition Collection - Elephant Shiraz (Paarl)
"Ripely fruity, with sun-warmed flavors of white peach and nectarine. Acids are fine, and boost the structure. There's also a subtle overlay of oak that adds to the tastes.",Perry Creek 2001 Chardonnay (El Dorado County)
"While this wine is labeled ""dry,"" it's technically not. There's some sugar left in it, it just seems dry if you compare it to the winery's regular, semi-dry version. Aromas of spiced pears and musky, evening flowers blend with flavors of pears, peaches and dried spices.",Glenora 2002 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Dramatically dark, staining the glass with glycerine streaks, this wine  unabashedly celebrates its hot country origins. Considerable tannins  frame a core of berry fruit, with a zingy, peppery note that stimulates  the taste buds, but acidity is soft. At the same time, it retains a  rustic character typical of the varietal.",Imagery 2000 Artist Collection Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"Pine needle, lilac and some musk on the nose. Citrus is the driving force from then on. There's tangerine and some melon for flavor, and plenty or orange and passion fruit on the finish. A drink-now citrus ball that's full and flavorful.",Torres 2002 Viña Sol White (Penedès)
"Smells and tastes like an inexpensive Aussie Shiraz, with jammy raspberry and cherry flavors and a dry, peppery finish. The texture is a little syrupy and thick, but it's a good, easy wine.",Maddalena 2000 Merlot (Central Coast)
"The acidity is in the forefront, with little structure or fruit to fill it out. The fruit displays notes of milk chocolate, red plum and fresh herbs. The toast and oakspice ride nicely on the clean finish.",Ken Forrester 2001 Merlot (Stellenbosch)
"This Riesling has refinement, elegance and freshness without huge complexity. It is a wine to drink now and over the next four or five years.",Hugel 2000 Riesling (Alsace)
"Dark and extracted, with jammy berry flavors and a strongly earthy component, including tobacco, sage and tree bark. In the mouth this wine is very dry and pretty tannic, although the acidity is soft. A bit awkward, and not likely to improve in the cellar.",Imagery 1999 Sunny Slope Vineyard Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
"A plummy, semi-sweet dark red wine that could stand a bit of a chill in the fridge. It has a nice chocolatey edge that would be a good partner with dark chocolate desserts. Finishes clean and with good acidity.",Rosenblum 2001 Gallagher Ranch Black Muscat (California)
"An eccentric version of Marlborough Riesling that tastes reminiscent of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with a green, underripe quality and some goosberry aromas on the nose. There's also a hint of riper, cinnamon-scented fruit and a clean, crisp finish.",Omaka Springs 2002 Riesling (Marlborough)
"A pleasant sipper at a nice price, this fruity wine has flavors of cherries and plums, and is soft and rich. Has more complexity and depth than you'd think, and is a very good value.",Redwood 2000 Merlot (California)
"This medium-bodied Chard has some butterscotch notes on the nose, but thankfully lacks similarly overpowering flavors on the palate. Some citrus flavors accent the wine's peachy core; finishes a little watery.",Yering Station 2000 Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
"Sometimes concept exceeds the wine itself, and this may be a case in point. The blend is odd, and the fact that each grape comes from a different part of Spain is potentially more odd. As for the wine, it has a nice perfume to it, courtesy of the Rhone varieties in the mix. And while the cherry/berry fruit is forward, it's maybe too sweet and basic in terms of length, structure and mouthfeel. Still, it's worth a try for the experimental tasters out there.",Bodegas Concavins 2000 Proyecto 4 Red (Conca de Barberà)
"Aromas of match stick and green herbs don't deliver much fruit. This feels round and regular, with grassy flavors along with hints of green bean and canned pea. Unresolved pyrazines on the finish result in an herbal, green flavor.",Viña Maipo 2015 Gran Devoción Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Light scents of fresh grass, white flowers, waxy melon and sweet orange dance in the bouquet of this easy-drinking white. Those notes continue through to the fruity palate, with a pleasant roundness to the midpalate. Drink now.",Wild Pig 2016 Viognier (Pays d'Oc)
"Quite forward in  character, this opens with powerful scents of purple flowers, black berry, cherry and plum. The palate is juicy and fruit forward, with hints of sweet spice and berry preserves that carry through to the medium-length finish. Drink now.",Barton & Guestier 2016 B&G Réserve Grenache Noir (Pays d'Oc)
"Underbrush, grilled herb, camphor and toasted notes lead the nose of this wine. The palate is raw, showing unripe cherry, orange peel and clove flavors alongside bracing tannins.",Cantina del Nebbiolo 2013 Meruzzano  (Barbaresco)
"This informal red has delicate black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The simple palate suggests black plum and clove, with a touch of tobacco. It's not very intense and already extremely accessible, so drink soon.",CarlindePaolo 2016 Cursus Vitae  (Barbera d'Asti)
"This leads with subtle black plum and cooking spice scents. The simple palate shows clove, tobacco and blackberry flavors. Drink soon.",Cascina Radice 2015 Roccanera  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Aromas suggesting cellar floor, camphor and paraffin lead the nose of this wine. The camphor note follows through to the lean palate, along with red berry, ground clove and powdered sage flavors. Bracing tannins leave an astringent, drying finish.",Castello di Neive 2014  Barbaresco
"Cherry and raspberry aromas are also stalky and gamy, a likely reflection of the 75% Syrah in this blend with Garnacha. A hard, grabby palate holds flavors of herbal plum and grape skins, while an obtuse finish tastes a little green.",Clos Pons 2015 Jan Petit Red (Costers del Segre)
"Leathery red-fruit aromas turn more gritty and earthy with airing. This feels chunky and full, without much elegance. Plum and rubbery berry flavors finish with a chocolaty oak note.",Coleccion Privada 2015 Gran Reserva Pinot Noir (Maule Valley)
"Minty berry aromas settle well and hold up to airing. This everyday Merlot is more than competent on the palate. Berry and spice flavors finish chewy, with standard ripeness and follow through.",Cuyen 2016 Merlot (Central Valley)
"This wine's oak, toasted nut and menthol aromas carry over to its evolved palate, along with a coffee note and bracing tannins. It's shy on fruit richness and intensity.",Dante Rivetti 2012 Bricco di Neive Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"After several years working in wine commerce and tourism, Céline Guguen-Brocard in 2013 studied winemaking. This is a bright result in partnership with Frédéric Gueguen, a former winemaker for her father, and Jean-Marc Brocard. This rosé is bright, crisp and full of cranberry fruit and tangy acidity. Drink now.",Domaine Gueguen 2016 Domaine Marie B.  (Bourgogne)
"A simple, soft Chardonnay from the Mâconnais region, this is rounded. A touch of caramel adds extra flavor to the warm fruit. Green plum and melon dominate this wine that is ready to drink.",Domaine Pascal et Mireille Renaud 2016  Mâcon-Villages
"Dusty earth tones add savoriness to fresh white peach in this dry, medium-bodied Pinot Gris. Fresh lemon-lime acidity maintains a lively, invigorating feel. Drink now.",Hosmer 2016 Estate Winery Pinot Gris (Cayuga Lake)
"With Carmenère and País in the blend along with Carignan, this shows a lot of “old country” character, namely a saucy, savory nose with herbal red-berry hints. Herbal plum and peppery flavors fade on an undistinguished finish.",J. Bouchon 2016 Canto Sur Red (Maule Valley)
"Yellow fruit and toast aromas set the scene for this soft, rounded wine. The apricot flavors are right there, lightly lifted by acidity. A gentle wine, it's ready to drink now.",Albert Bichot 2016  Mâcon-Villages
"Heavy aromas of herbal berry fruits and wood smoke are rustic. This wine feels resiny and edgy, while saucy, oaky flavors of pancetta and tomato finish with notes of sausage, fennel and bacon.",TerraNoble 2013 Reserva Terroir La Higuera Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"This offers bright raspberry jam, herb, pepper and spice aromas. It's full of vanilla flavors, seeming somewhat disjointed.",Kestrel 2013 Falcon Series Tribute Red (Yakima Valley)
"This spritzy, 100% Viognier wine delivers melon, citrus zest and floral flavors. It drinks dry, fresh, clean and tart—an unusual interpretation of the variety.",Kestrel 2014 Falcon Series Frizzante White (Yakima Valley)
"This wine's perfumed melon, white flower, vanilla and baking spice scents are followed by broad stone fruit flavors that finish tart. It goes down easy.",Kestrel 2016 Falcon Series Estate Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)
"This wine's oak, weedy underbrush, celery and vegetable broth aromas carry over to the lean palate, along with a roasted coffee bean note. Raspy tannins clench the finish.",La Spinetta 2013 Vigneto Bordini  (Barbaresco)
"A white chocolate accent adds a touch of weight to the white cherry and watermelon aromas in the nose of this wine. The palate offers surprising weight, but it's countered by ample acidity and a citrus zest flavor that livens-up the finish.",Le Grand Noir 2016 Rosé (Pays d'Oc)
"Smooth and creamy, this is a simple, soft wine. Clean, full of yellow fruits with just enough acidity, it is rounded, finishing with orange-zest tang. Drink now.",Loron et Fils 2016 Château de Mirande  (Mâcon-Villages)
"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins.",Maryhill 2014 Les Collines Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This wine's smoke, seaweed, black pepper, orange peel and purple fruit aromas pop. The palate features easy-drinking fruit flavors, with gritty tannins to back them up.",Maryhill 2015 Winemaker's Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
The deep-copper color and complex fruit aromas of this wine seem well matched with a rather broad texture and medium-full body. The raspberry flavors have a meaty savory accent.,Muddy Boot 2016 Rosé of Pinot Noir (California)
"Oaky and robust, this wine takes on a confectionery route to tropical flavor and high-octane concentration, offering a thickness of texture and body. Stainless-steel fermented, it unveils secondary flavors of lime and white peach on the finish.",Napa Cellars 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This wine's nose suggests game, forest floor, truffle and leather. It's tight and raw, offering roasted coffee bean, powdered sage, licorice and unripe cherry notes set against a backdrop of raspy tannins and firm acidity.",Pietro Rinaldi 2013 Santo Cristoforo  (Barbaresco)
"This opens with prune, menthol, nail varnish and plastic aromas. The palate is tired and evolved, showing dried black cherry and fig flavors, with a hint of orange peel and worn tannins. It finishes short.",Punset 2012 Basarin Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"This wine's subdued baking spice, clove and mature black-skinned fruit aromas follow through to the lively, simple palate. Round tannins provide easygoing support. Drink soon.",Cascina Radice 2015 S. Martino  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Let's hope this isn't the future of California Pinotage, because the wine smells and tastes Porty, even though the alcohol isn't that high. There's a raisiny, stewed berry element that ends in a dry, harsh finish.",French Hill 2005 Premium Select Pinotage (Sierra Foothills)
"A difficult wine to like, as it lacks charm. There's something rustic in the orange marmalade and sugared herb tea flavors that accentuates the tannins and acids, making the finish harsh.",Grgich Hills 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This thin, light effort carries flavors of baby aspirin, or orange candy. It's one dimensional, bearing little varietal character.",Bridgeview 2006 Viognier (Southern Oregon)
"This is a candy sweet, soft wine with flavors of pineapples, orange blossoms, apricots, peaches and caramel. Drink now.",Castoro Cellars 2006 Roussanne (Paso Robles)
"Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel.",Vin Nostro 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Kalbarri's Cab boasts plenty of red-berry flavors and a soft, easygoing, maybe even slightly sweet, finish.",Kalbarri 2006 Bin Select 513 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Harveys NV Fino Light Sherry (Jerez)
"Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",Septima 2006 Tempranillo (Mendoza)
"There is not much going on here. As with most California Pinots in this price range, the Erath is a stripped-down, pale and insubstantial take on the grape. Pinots may be light and still profound, but this is simply light and watery.",Erath 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"This is an odd duck for Gewürz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape. It's lemony and slightly sweet, with good acid. It makes a pleasant, if generic white wine to accompany spicy noodles or light seafood.",Bridgeview 2006 Gewürztraminer (Southern Oregon)
"Earthy, spicy aromas lead, rolling into smoky layers of typical Cab flavors. Berry, tobacco and touches of sweet oak give it okay complexity.",Snake River 2003 Arena Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Idaho)
"A good balance of berry, spice and fruit recommend this; it has balance and structure and a degree of complexity that will lend it to pairing with heartier dishes. An interesting and fun wine.",Vivác Winery 2005 V. Single Vineyard Nebbiolo (New Mexico)
"This smells of burnt match and soap, with flavors of very tart citrus and hints of pear and orange. There's plenty of acid but not much weight to the mid-palate.",Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"Sharp and jammy, with blackberry and cherry flavors. It's a simple, direct wine that needs a big, juicy cheeseburger.",Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Merlot (California)
"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Celler La Bollidora 2005 Plan B Red (Terra Alta)
"The nose on this Merlot is earthy, with savory scents of mushroom, soft fruit and spice, but on the palate, the wine could use a bit more structure and presence. Overall though, it's balanced and friendly, and will pair well with myriad mild-flavored dishes.",Chaddsford 2005 Merlot (Pennsylvania)
"An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
"Sharp and rustic, with medicinal, LifeSaver candy cherry flavors that finish with a scour of acidity.",Shannon Ridge 2006 Grenache (Lake County)
"Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine.",Norman 2003 Conquest Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Lightly tropical, with peach, citrus and pineapple aromas. The palate offers mostly sharp citrus flavors of lime and orange, and the finish holds onto that theme.",Funky Llama 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (Calchaquí Valley)
"The entrance of violets and black cherry is offset by volatility and lingering scents and flavors of nail polish through the wine's mid-palate. It finishes with earthy, rough tannins",Bridgeview 2004 Black Beauty Syrah (Southern Oregon)
"Both a study of clone and stainless-steel processing, this wine offers fresh-cut pineapple, ripe Gala apple, honeydew and even peach, with a citrus-skin sharpness to the nose. The flavors are delicate and familiar but complex and deep, with Anjou pears, lemon-lime soda and apple flesh. It's a lively stainless expression.",Melville 2014 Clone 76 Inox Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Rich, satisfying and full bodied, this wine is packed with delicious fruit and spice flavors while structured by good acidity and fine tannins that keep the texture lively. Layers of cherry, currant, cedar and cinnamon fill the flavor profile, and a long finish completes the package.",Panthea 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"This wine, made by Native American descendent Tara Gomez from the Chumash tribe, is dynamic on the nose. It shows both ripeness and minerality, with aromas of crystallized white peach, dewy herbs, green apples and a hint of guava. It's tight, steely and chalky once sipped, opening toward ripe pome fruit and cut grass, ever-evolving in the glass without going overripe.",Kitá 2013 Camp 4 Vineyard Grenache Blanc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect apéritif or brunch wine.",LaStella 2013 Moscato d'Osoyoos Moscato (Okanagan Valley)
"This blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Petite Sirah offers suave aromas of cherry, vanilla and white chocolate. The palate is dense with fudge flavors as well as black-cherry sauce, dark chocolate, slight bits of chopped mint and decent acidity to clean it all up.",Lorenzi Estate 2011 The Phantom Red (Temecula)
"This full-bodied but far from heavy wine has wonderful aromatic complexity, evoking Bing cherries, black tea, clove and pine forest, while the flavors gush with red cherry and rhubarb. The slightly lean and crisp balance combines with bright and layered flavors in an appealing way. Best through 2020.",Loring Wine Company 2013 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Firm, concentrated and dense, this is a solid wine with a good future. Rich black fruits, red cherries and expressive acidity are all coming together alongside the dry core of tannins. Age this fine wine and drink from 2017.",Lucien Lardy 2014 Côte du Py  (Morgon)
"Cool, earthy, rooty aromas of licorice, Graham cracker, cassis and blackberry are dark and brooding. This Malbec is loosely structured, with heavy extraction and blackened, gritty flavors of blackberry and toast. A dark, rubbery, blocky finish is giant like the rest of the wine. Drink through 2022.",Andeluna 2012 Pasionado Malbec (Tupungato)
"A blend of 70% Chardonnay and 30% Pinot Nero, this elegant wine opens with an alluring fragrance of white flowers and stone fruit. Made with no dosage, the linear palate offers juicy yellow apple, citrus, toasted almond and a hint of spice. A refined perlage accentuates the mineral finish.",Barone Pizzini 2011 Naturae Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"The balance of this wine is immediately striking. Everything is in its place: the crisp apples, tight acidity and the mineral texture are all just right. It's a delicious, perfumed and fragrant wine that is ready to drink with its light, poised aftertaste.",Billecart-Salmon NV Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.",Bodega Catena Zapata 2011 Nicolas Catena Zapata Red (Mendoza)
"This elegant sparkler opens with alluring aromas of fragrant jasmine, wisteria and white peach. Thanks to 80-year old vines, the linear palate has both finesse and concentration, offering ripe yellow apple, Bartlett pear, energizing mineral tones and a saline note alongside a creamy mousse.",Ca' dei Zago 2013 Dosaggio Zero  (Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore)
"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.",Cave Spring 2012 CSV Estate Bottled Riesling (Beamsville Bench)
"Dense and intense, with loads of fine-grained tannin, this is a deep, dark-colored wine with oodles of flavor and a very thick texture. As massive as it is in texture though, delicious flavors like blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate come through and then linger on the finish. Drink from 2016 to 2026.",Cedarville Vineyard 2012 Naylor Vineyard Petite Sirah (El Dorado)
"This big-boy, 100% varietal Cab is reflective of both its vintage and provenance, a celebration of black pepper, blackberry and tar around an intensely full-bodied, bittersweet palate. Tobacco leaf and leather saddle interweave themselves through the wine's middle and end. Drink now through 2020.",D.R. Stephens 2012 Walther River Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"This is a rich, inviting wine with characteristics of dried cranberry and red currant, replete with dusty, spicy tannins and spicy, spiked vanilla. Lush, the tannins are soft and supple, a tad smoky, and the secondary elements darker in smoke, black licorice and espresso. Burly, it's balanced and refined.",Ehlers Estate 2012 Estate Merlot (St. Helena)
"Phil Sexton's wines under the Giant Steps label are becoming more consistent, and the 2014s may be his best yet. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, with a supple, creamy texture and lingering notes of spring flowers and black cherries. Subtle oaking adds brown sugar and mocha shadings to the crisp finish. Drink now–2022.",Giant Steps 2014 Sexton Vineyard Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley)
"Already showing maturity, this is a rich wine, despite its low dosage. It shows layers of Pinot Noir from premier cru vineyards on the Montagne de Reims. With ripe fruit flavors that are generous in texture, the wine is ready to drink.",Henriet-Bazin 2009 Premier Cru Brut Nature Millésime  (Champagne)
"Coming from the warmer Aube region, Laurent's Chardonnay offering is ripe and hinting at yellow fruits while also retaining a steely, mineral character. It is fresh, rich, well textured and ready to drink, crisp and bright at the end.",Jean Laurent NV Blanc de Blancs Réserve Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"To judge by the cork, this bottling has some age, giving it a toasty as well as fruity character that adds complexity to this baked-apple and citrus-flavored wine. It also means that it needs no further aging and is delicious to drink now.",Louis Roederer NV Brut Premier  (Champagne)
"This is an initially smooth wood-aged wine that is intense, concentrated and packed with power and tannins. It is rich and full of brooding dark plum and dense with structure. Dominated by Touriga Nacional, it has that variety's perfumed character which is balanced by the smoother Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz. It is obviously a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",Quinta das Carvalhas 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)
"This young wine is fruity and fresh, perfumed with spice and lemon blossom. The tight texture will soften as the wine ages to bring out the warmth and richness of the vintage. Keep this long-term wine and drink from 2018.",A.R. Lenoble  2009 Premier Cru Blanc de Noirs Bisseuil Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"Young, tight and compact, this is all about red fruits and red licorice. There's a dash of peppermint as well, on the way to a smooth, milk-chocolate finish. This seems sure to continue to improve through 2020 or more.",Bergström 2013 Gregory Ranch Pinot Noir
"Silky and fragrant, this opens with aromas of Spanish broom, pressed white flowers, baked apple and citrus. The firm, vibrant palate delivers ripe Bartlett pear, nectarine zest, lime and a note of crystallized ginger alongside tangy acidity and firm, refined perlage.",Corte Moschina 2009  Lessini Durello
"An excellent medium-bodied wine from an estate better known for its olives, this is dark in color but with a lighter, tawny rim. The complex aromas combine sweet baking spices with ample cherry and berry notes. Flavors kick in with juicy strawberry, dark cherry and subtle shadings of nutmeg and wood smoke. The texture is plush and almost soft, and the taste is warmly luxurious.",McEvoy Ranch 2012 The Evening Standard Pinot Noir (Marin County)
"This 100% varietal wine makes the case for Viognier in this appellation, expressing Golden Delicious apple and pear around a fresh, medium build of viscous texture, lemon and wild honey. Pretty and aromatic, it's a classically fine-formed white, made in small quantities.",Meadowcroft 2014 Louvau Vineyard Viognier (Dry Creek Valley)
"The last vintage that the Melvilles are pulling from this Los Alamos Valley vineyard, this wine shows a complex nose of lemon candy, dill and fresh oregano. There is plenty of tension and grip on the palate, thanks to the lime-pith flavors, but a show of white flowers like tuberose keeps it properly ripe.",Melville 2013 Verna's Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"This is proving to be a great vintage for this emerging producer in an increasingly exciting region of mid-Monterey County. Graphite, crushed rocks, rose petals and cranberry show on the nose, followed by a palate of black peppercorns, eucalyptus, snappy black raspberry and lots of black clove.",Mercy 2012 Cedar Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Rustic earth gives way to bright, crisp red fruit and a hit of citrus providing freshness and life. Soft and full bodied, this wine has years to go in the cellar—through 2022—to let the tannins soften and integrate further with the fruit.",Merryvale 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)
"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character.",Metz Road 2012 Riverview Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Monterey)
"The quality here has been consistent over the past few vintages, offering solid value in an easy-drinking style. It leads with herbal aromas, but the flavors are less green, more melon and fig carried by a sense of creamy lushness. Drink now.",Starborough 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Made in a New Zealand style, which is very dry, crisp in acidity, minerally and rich in citrus flavors, with a sour, green note of gooseberry. A brisk Sauvignon Blanc that will love goat cheese.",Wellington 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley)
"Lots to like in this silky wine. It has a very pure, light feeling in the mouth, with pleasant cherry, cranberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. But it tastes too tutti-fruity sweet throughout, and turns candied on the finish.",Kokomo 2008 Gopher Hill Block Peter's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"A great deal from Tuscany, this bright Sangiovese-based wine offers playful aromas of cassis, cherry and wild berry with red rose and a touch of toasted almond.",Vignamaggio 2008 Il Morino Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Brisk in acids, with lush, long hangtime lemon, kiwi, tangerine and vanilla flavors. It's all upfront in this drily delicious Chardonnay.",Manzoni 2008 Lucia Highland Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Piccini offers good value deals from Tuscany and this Riserva Chianti Classico follows in that tradition. The wine is compact and clean, in typical Sangiovese fashion, and ends with a bright blast of mouth-freshening acidity.",Piccini 2006 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"Dry, creamy and crisp, with pleasant citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, this Chardonnay shows a lot of upscale character at a price under $20. Easy to find, with 200,000 cases produced.",Simi 2009 Chardonnay (Sonoma County)
"Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint. The vintage was a difficult one for St. Supéry. The wine is lacks the stuffing for ageability. Drink now–2013.",St. Supéry 2006 Elu Red (Napa Valley)
"Terra Rossa (red earth) Riserva really does recall moist soil aromas with iron-rich notes of rust, clove and red berry fruit. Those warm, earthy tones are backed by mouth-freshening acidity.",Tenuta di Trecciano 2006 Terra Rossa Riserva  (Chianti Colli Senesi)
"Freshly acidic and jammy in blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, this is one of the fruitier Napa Cabs available. It's at its best now, so drink up with a nice steak.",Textbook 2008 Fin de Journée Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Banfi presents an easy, no-fuss Chianti Classico that showcases Sangiovese typicity and personality. This is a profoundly food-friendly wine with built-in natural acidity that pairs it with butter or cream-based pasta dishes.",Banfi 2007 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)
"This Riserva Chianti Rufina offers clean, crisp aromas of wild berry and white cherry with distant renderings of spice and earth in the background. Pair this wine with roast chicken or pork.",Bellini 2005 Riserva  (Chianti Rufina)
"A very pleasant wine for drinking now. It shows cherry, blueberry, blackberry and mocha flavors, wrapped into finely ground, soft tannins, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The blend is a Bordeaux-style, with some Syrah.",Blue Rock 2008 Baby Blue Red (Alexander Valley)
"Earthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short.",Juan Gil 2007 Monastrell (Jumilla)
"A big, dark, heavily oaked wine with caramel, resin and baked berry aromas. The palate has a thick, meaty feel, slightly abrasive tannins, and then sweet, sticky, woody black fruit flavors. Finishes with brown sugar and more wood flavor; strives for a higher level but gets bogged down with barrel influence.",Juan Gil 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla)
"Big, chunky, rubbery and loud, but also poised and fruity. The palate is fierce and full, with some scratch but also very lush and ripe flavors of jammy blackberry. Fruity to the max, with a chocolaty finish. A massive wine for $12.",Montes 2009 Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"Zippy and fresh with a gentle prickle on the tongue, this dry Riesling smells of sweet, fresh apples laced with just a hint of petrol. On the palate, soft apple and pear flavors are edged with slate and stones, and a shower of fresh lime on the finish.",Heron Hill 2008 Ingle Vineyard Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Just lovely to drink now, it's so softly lush and decadently delicious. Beguiles the palate with jammy, pastry flavors of raspberries, cherries and sweet oak. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.",Sterling 2007 SVR Reserve Red (Napa Valley)
"Lagone is a pleasurable and rich blend of Merlot, Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Sangiovese that opens with rich, dark color and intense aromas of sweet spice, chocolate, cherry and tobacco. The wine feels chewy and smooth in the mouth with a long, velvety feel on the close.",Aia Vecchia 2008 Lagone Red (Toscana)
"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.",Atmosphere 2008 Bismark Mountain Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"Rich, smooth, with great wafts of creaminess to go with a judicious amount of toast. White plum and pear flavors precede a finish with impressive concentration and delicious acidity.",Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2009 Catarina White (Península de Setúbal)
"Super smooth and complete on the nose, with black fruit, toasty oak and earth notes rolled into a nice whole. It's lush, plump and balanced, with full blackberry, raisin, chocolate and spice flavors resting in front of a mellow, spicy finish. A pretty, balanced blend of 75% Tempranillo and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon that shows Jumilla at its best.",Bodegas Mähler-Besse 2005 Taja Excelecia Red (Jumilla)
"Made in a more forward style than it used to be, Calera's '07 Jensen appeals for its lush raspberry, cherry, bacon, vanilla and sandalwood flavors. The acidity is just fine, and the tannins are soft and intricate. Lovely now, with a brief decant, and should develop for 6–8 years.",Calera 2007 Jensen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan)
"If you can accept a slight hint of jamminess, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is for you. Beyond the ripe cherry and blackberry is a beautiful blast of pleasure and opulence. Pair this wine with succulent cuts of red meat.",Cipriana 2007 San Martino  (Bolgheri Superiore)
"Here's a small producer with a vineyard and bed & breakfast in coastal Tuscany that proves to be a promising newcomer. This 60-40 blend of Cabernet and Syrah (aged in cement tanks and barrique) shows dark, inky notes of black fruit and graphite. The fruit is succulent, rich and the wine shows a big, bold style.",Eucaliptus 2008 Clarice  (Bolgheri)
"From the far north of the Vinho Verde region, the rich and creamy wine balances acidity, green plum and crisp minerality. Aromatic, elegant, fresh.",Wines & Winemakers 2009 Touquinheiras White (Vinho Verde)
"Roasted and baked on first blush, but then the wine's complexity and use of unusual Mallorcan grape varieties take over. Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas. Drink now through 2011–12.",Ànima Negra 2007 ÀN/2 Red (Vi de la Terra Illes Balears)
"A great, concentrated wine, rich, with a burnt almond character and delicious acidity. It keeps some freshness while showing a fine sense of maturity.",Borges NV Roncão 20-Year-Old Tawny  (Port)
"This is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay, built on a foundation of superripe pineapple, lime and golden mango fruit and elaborated with sweet, caramelized oak. Bright, zesty Edna Valley acidity balances the opulence.",Chamisal Vineyards 2008 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"An impressively structured wine, full of concentrated fruit and tannins. It shows ripe plums, layered with chocolate, spice and a hint of pepper, finished with wood. It needs aging 3–4 years.",Château de Minière 2008 Vieilles Vignes Cabernet Franc (Bourgueil)
"A smooth and velvet-textured wine, where the tannins are a cushion for the ripe plum juice fruit. Herbs and wood spice contribute to this rich and full-bodied wine.",Château Fonguillon 2005  Montagne-Saint-Émilion
"Saint-Croix-du-Mont is on the slopes across the Garonne river from Sauternes. In years like 2005, it can produce some fine sweet botrytis wines. This has honey, a bite of botrytis and a great lemon edge. Worth aging, but ready to drink now.",Château La Rame 2005  Saint-Croix-du-Mont
"The wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate.",King Estate 2008 Domaine Pinot Noir (Oregon)
"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears. The sur lie aging shows up in a creamy, yeasty richness. Holding this wine for a year or two will not harm it.",Lynmar 2008 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"A taut and mineral wine, with intense acidity followed by peach flavors. The wine successfully manages   to combine a crisp edge and rich fruit, with delicious results.",Pascal & Nicolas Reverdy 2008 Les Coûtes  (Sancerre)
"Another successful Marinus from this small Monterey County appellation. Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it's dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, crème de cassis and cedar, and is more rough in tannins than your typical Napa Cabernet blend. Drink now–2013.",Bernardus 2007 Marinus Red (Carmel Valley)

"An aromatic, fruity nose and balanced fruity/floral flavors recommend this elegant Chardonnay from Recas. Good minerality and acid and a lingering finish add to the appeal. Pair with poultry, pork.",Cramele Recas 2008 Chardonnay (Recas)
"Frank Cornelissen doesn't like Malvasia, nor does he like Inzolia. Therefore he added 20% Nerello Mascalese and decided to make a rosé instead. Copper-colored Susucaru offers aromas of butterscotch and ripe melon over resin and maple syrup. In the mouth, you'll feel slight tannic firmness. Only 900 bottles are made.",Frank Cornelissen 2008 Susucaru 2 Rosato Rosé (Etna)
"A soft, approachable wine whose pleasure is in its extreme dryness. Shows peppery flavors of tobacco, wild blackberries, bacon and anise.",Gnarly Head 2007 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"Opens with honest green notes of gooseberry, lime and sea foam, and while the palate is a touch soft in texture, it has true Chilean SB flavors of bell pepper, fresh lettuce and melon. Sturdy on the finish, with a forward attitude.",Yali 2009 Wetland Winemaker's Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Rapel Valley)
"This totally fresh wine has benefited from the quality of whites in 2007 Bordeaux. It is lemony with pink grapefruit flavors giving an intense lift. There is some herbaceousness, with green herbs and juicy fruits. To drink now.",Yvon Mau 2007 Premius Bordeaux Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Dry and scoury in texture, this everyday Merlot has flavors of cherries, currants, cocoa, and cedar. It has some real richness.",One Hope 2006 Merlot (California)

"Mildly baked plum and berry aromas are big and solid, while the big-boned palate revolves around plum and rhubarb flavors. Straightforward and a touch herbal, with sticky, chewy fruit to ponder on the finish.",Pasion de Tango 2007 Reserve Malbec (Mendoza)
"Elements of this thick, ripe, almost late-harvest SB succeed. The palate is creamy and layered, and it works that angle to its advantage. By the same token, it's flat and won't last for much longer, and the finish is pithy and borderline cloying. Drink right away.",Simone 2008 Special Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Maule Valley)
"This is a northern Italian Cabernet with a light, informal style and low intensity. The wine delivers measured aromas of cherry, pine, cedar and ends with a crisp note of acidity.",Bellenda 2005 Col di Luna Cabernet Sauvignon (Piave)
"A heavy dose of Sauvignon Blanc brings herbaceous, grassy, white currants and gooseberry flavors. It's young, and needs more time to coalesce. It is certainly fresh, fruity, right up front.",Château Lamothe-Vincent 2008 Sauvignon  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"This wine doesn't seem to have fully evolved and its aromas are  muddled in places with notes of mature fruit and natural rubber. In the mouth it has red fruit flavors and tight tannins, but it generally lacks definition.",Montresor 2003 Capitel della Crosara  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This sophisticated Sauvignon Blanc sets itself apart with its rich nose of nuts, vanilla and flowers, followed by pretty flavors of spice and white flowers and fruit. Acidity balances the fruit. A fuller-bodied style that can handle richer seafood dishes.",Domaine Costa Lazaridi 2008 Amethystos Sauvignon Blanc (Drama)
"A pretty good Chardonnay. Its a little pineapple juicy, and the oak is pretty strong, but a streak of minerality and crisp, clean acidity give just enough structure.",Dutch Bill Creek 2007 Heintz Ranch Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"This poised white offers aromas of honeysuckle, pear and flowers, and on the palate, curvy flavors of spice, apples and pear. Charming—serve chilled with cheese, dessert.",Heavenly Retreat 2007 Riesling (Recas)
"A roasted, leathery cap sits atop a bouquet of meaty berry fruit, leading to a somewhat burnt and brambly set of aromas. The palate, however, is quite fresh and edgy, with good acidity pushing lively red-fruit and mild vanilla flavors. Herbal on the finish, but sturdy overall.",Alpataco 2007 Reserve Merlot (Neuquén)
"Dark and baked, with hickory, leather and prune/black plum aromas that are slightly herbal and roasted. The palate has a tight, solid feel but presents savory, baked flavors of plum and soy sauce. Salty liked cured meat on the roasted finish.",Aresti 2008 Estate Selection Carmenère (Curicó Valley)
"A fine, useful Chardonnay, made in the modern ripe style. Bursts with juicy pineapple, Key lime pie, Meyer lemon, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, accented with crisp coastal acidity.",Black Box 2008 Chardonnay (Monterey County)
"The initial impression is of a jammy, almost sweet wine. Later bright berry fruits, some wood and a dense tannin core kick in. With its sweet chocolate and juicy edge, this is a wine ready to drink now. Screwcap.",Château Lamothe-Vincent 2007 Intense  (Bordeaux)
"Light, fresh and soft, this is a perfect starter for an evening for two. It has attractive sweet lime and peach flavors, with attendant acidity.",Pommery NV POP Extra Dry  (Champagne)
"This slightly sweet white starts with a lush nose of flowers, orange marmalade and spice, followed by floral flavors edged with spice and minerals. Not overly complex, but paired with grilled fish or squid, a unique and tasty sip.",Protopapas 2008 Traminer (Pageon)
"Soft and tannic, with a sour candy-sweet taste, this Cab has flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, anise and cedar. Drink now.",Rancho Sisquoc 2006 Flood Family Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Barbara County)
"Lean and spicy in the nose, with a hint of pepper and some green vegetables. The palate is a continuation of the nose: there's mild red fruit but also some strong green-bean and bell-pepper flavors. The finish is dry and tannic, as it should be.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2001 Los Vascos Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Light and lean pear fruit, with subtle lime notes and a hint of sweetness appearing on the finish.",San Giuseppe 2002 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"It's too hot for Pinot Noir in Paso Robles, right? This wine shows why. It's not bad, but clumsy, with heavy, earthy flavors. It lacks delicacy and subtlety, which is what Pinot Noir is all about.",Zenaida Cellars 2000 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles)
"The nose is like citrus candy and applesauce, but it doesn't sing or pop like it could. The mouth is easygoing, with melon and grapefruit, but there's also a bit of unwelcome green bean. This wine fails to excite. —M.S. .",Morandé 2002 Sauvignon Blanc (Central Valley)
"Mushroom and charcoal dot the nose, but with that comes just a modicum of fruit. The palate is a bit bland even if it's far from offensive, and so is the finish. Some wines don't offend while they fail to impress. This is an example of that type of wine.",Calama 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"Tight and oaky in the nose, with some funky green notes. The palate is a bit herbal and mildly vegetal, but there's also some cherry fruit and spice. The texture on the finish is the high point, but the vegetal flavor at the wine's core is a sore point.",Casa Rivas 2001 Estate Bottled Carmenère (Maipo Valley)
"A surprisingly poor showing from this normally reliable winery, the 2000 Classico, a blend of Pinot Bianco, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, shows some lemony aromas, a plump, custardy mouthfeel and a tangy finish.",Cantina Terlano 2000 Classico White (Alto Adige)
"Shows the ill effects of age on this style of wine already. The vibrant, fresh fruit is fading, being replaced by some dusty spice notes.",Santi 2001 Sortesele Pinot Grigio (Trentino)
"Simple and watery, with vaguely fruity flavors of peaches and citrus. Very dry, with adequate acidity.",Pepperwood Grove 2001 Viognier (California)
"Light, and seems mature already, with modest cherry and tobacco flavors and tea leaves on the finish.",Piccini 2001  Chianti
"Lightly fruity in the nose, yet sharp on the palate. For a reserve wine, it's noticeably thinner and more linear than the regular Sauvignon Blanc. The flavors are of green apple and underripe citrus, while the finish, as the palate suggests, is lean and fresh, but lightweight.",Viña Casas del Bosque 2002 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Pineapple and other tropical fruits comprise the simple, straightforward nose. Pear and tangerine flavors come across sharp, as does the finish. The wine is a bit edgy and lean on its own.",La Palma 2002 Estate Bottled Chardonnay (Cachapoal Valley)
"Briar patch, some green pepper and a little sweet baking spice carry the nose. The plum and berry flavors are accented by brown sugar and caramel, but also some green characteristics. The finish is smooth, but too green.",Calama 2001 Merlot (Casablanca Valley)
"Anise and mineral add character to the aggressive, starchy nose. Flavors of ripe apple and mustard create a heavier-than-usual palate, although there's ample acidity to keep it more or less balanced. The finish is dry, with just a touch of citrus flavor. And at the very end it turns thin and rough.",Guelbenzu 2002 Jardin Chardonnay (Colchagua Valley)
"Dusty, peppery aromas carry little richness, but in the mouth things turn more fruity. You get cherry and plum, but also a salty edge. The texture is smooth and solid enough, but the finish is disproportionately buttery, salty and mildly vegetal.",San Pedro 2002 Gato Negro Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Valley)
"Kind of unripe and thin, with tobacco, beet and herb flavors, although a touch of black cherry helps. The texture is smooth, but the finish is a little watery.",MacMurray Ranch 2001 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Light and simple, with green apple and citrus aromas and flavors. Use it to wash down steamed shellfish at the beach.",Quinta da Romeira 2001 Estate Bottled Arinto (Bucelas)
"Dark and earthy, slightly pruny and alcoholic, finishing on notes of tar and molasses.",L.A. Cetto 1999 Petite Sirah (Valle de Guadalupe)
"A deep gold color sends up warning flags, and the flavors bear that out. Has simple apple flavors with a touch of shellac and no depth. Kosher.",Bartenura 2000 Pinot Grigio (Veneto)
"Pungent, grassy aromas seem off center for Chardonnay, while the mouthfeel is heavy and the flavors seem derived from overripe fruit. The finish is woody and has plenty of texture, but there's also a piercing bolt of acidity running through the middle.",Château Los Boldos 1999 CLB Reserve Chardonnay (Rapel Valley)
"A light spritz gives this wine some of the character of club soda and lime, with a slight brinyness to add interest.",Quinta da Aveleda NV Casal Garcia White (Vinho Verde)
"Early aromas of sea water, mushroom and rubber integrate into a more pleasant whole. The flavors are sweet and candied, while on the finish a mild vegetal hint comes on. That said, the wine is decent in the mouth, where the texture is pleasant.",Vino de Eyzaguirre 2001 San Francisco de Mostazal Reserva Especial Syrah (Colchagua Valley)
This is a soft slightly sweet wine (dry in Champagne means sweeter than Brut) with red-berry fruits and balanced acidity. It has a ripe full rich aftertaste. Drink now.,Collet NV Rosé Dry Collection Privée  (Champagne)

"A very subdued nose leads to a fresh, lively and light palate that displays subtle red-currant fruit. Freshness makes this appetizing while the finish is dry and refreshing.",Domaine Michel Fonne NV Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace)
"Nicely balanced and fairly fruity, this wine is easy to like for its crisp apple and grapefruit aromas, fresh and ripe flavors and smooth and lively texture.",Fetzer 2016 Echo Ridge Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"Just a single barrel of this wine was produced. Although it's a 2016, the wine is a straw gold and seems well on the way to maturity. Ripe and tangy apples and pears abound, with a squirt of lemon juice. Drink now through 2018.",Freja 2016 Albariño (Chehalem Mountains)
"Honeysuckle and orchard-fruit aromas lead the nose while the bright enjoyable palate offers ripe pear, green apple and candied citrus peel. It's easygoing, with fresh acidity and soft continuous bubbles.",Gino Fasoli 2016 Tasi Brut  (Prosecco)
"Deeply gold-colored, this opens with aromas of oak, bread crust and toasted nut. The scents carry over to the lean palate along with hints of overripe orange peel, a suggestion of dried apricot and a dollop of vanilla. Drink now to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.",Miklus 2014 Malvasia (Collio)
"Very fruity in flavor and tangy in mouthfeel, this full-bodied wine combines lively acidity with citrus, herb and ripe pear flavors and a touch of sweetness. Little or no oak influence comes through, so the vivid fruit components take center stage.",Muddy Boot 2016 Johas Vineyard Chardonnay (Clarksburg)
"Unmistakably a Kiwi Pinot Noir, with notes of Dr. Pepper, ripe bramble fruit, oaky spices and tree bark, it loses it's way a little on the palate, lacking the juicy fruit to stand up to all the oak.",Nga Waka 2015 Three Paddles Pinot Noir (Martinborough)
"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an apéritif.",North 42 Degrees 2016 Sweet Riesling (Lake Erie North Shore)
"Grassy, floral and herbal, this nice white comes from a well-regarded site devoted to the variety. Melon and fuzzy peach flavors highlight its dry, diluted palate, with moderate acidity.",Portalupi 2016 Las Brisas Vineyard Vermentino (Carneros)
"A touch of honey and nettle plays on the nose. The frothy, fizzing palate delivers off-dry fruit notes of yellow pear and ripe citrus. Light and fresh, the body finishes just about dry. Drink soon.",Schlumberger Wein- und Sektkellerei NV White Secco Méthode Traditionelle Sparkling (Niederösterreich)
"This well-balanced, flavorful and medium-bodied wine will pair nicely with many different meat, poultry and pasta dishes without distracting from the food. It smells lightly spicy, tastes like raspberries and red cherries and has light tannins that add some needed grip.",Shooting Star 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit.",Township 7 2014 Rock Pocket Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Okanagan Valley)
"This pale-colored rosé comes from a producer based in the Aube region. The wine is smooth, raspberry flavored and with a light tang of acidity. The wine is fruity, with a strong sense of the structure and flavor of the wine used to give color. Drink now.",Jean Laurent NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Champagne)

It's simple, offering red cherry, currant and cedar flavors, with firm, persistent tannins and a ripe, round mouthfeel.",Lasseter 2013 Paysage Estate Grown Red (Sonoma Valley)
"An ebullient mousse gives this wine a creamy texture. The wine, which is soft and rounded, is cut with acidity to give a crisp edge to the fruitiness. With its relatively high dosage, this is probably best as an apéritif.",Louis Chalvon NV Grande Réserve Brut  (Champagne)
"Just off dry, the wine has retained crisp acidity as well as ripe apple and spice flavors. It is a rounded wine, rich with a touch of almonds as well as pear and a final tang of acidity. Drink now.",Mailly Grand Cru NV Délice Demi-Sec  (Champagne)
"Bright fruit flavors light up this tart, medium-bodied wine. It smells like raspberries and red cherries, tastes crisp and bright and has a light nip of cranberry-like astringency.",Wilderotter 2014 Barbera (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up.",Yamhill Valley 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"A small portion of this wine (10%) is barrel fermented, which seems to slightly soften and round out the feel. Fleshy pear and apple comes with a hint of honey on the palate.",Apolloni 2016 L Cuvée Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)

"A wine with some warm black cherry fruit as well as structured acidity. It has a dry texture to go with the fruit, making it a ripe but food friendly wine.",Vignerons de Bel Air 2010 Automne Festif  (Côte de Brouilly)
"Smooth, sweet and savory, this Cabernet has forward flavors of blackberries, black currants, cola and sweet oak. It's an easy wine to drink now.",Windsor Sonoma 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"You get plenty of rich, ripe cherry, red currant, cappuccino and peppery spice flavors in this briskly tannic, dry young Merlot. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, though. Drink up.",Y Rousseau 2009 Cavedale Vineyards Pépé Merlot (Sonoma Valley)
"A sweet-and-sour wine that mixes sour lemon candy with honey cough-drop elements. There is also an underlying streak of baby aspirin flavor, and the different aspects of the wine are not quite pulled together.",Smasne Cellars 2010 Viognier (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a fresh, tonic and light Grillo that would pair with endive salad and sliced oranges or red beets in vinaigrette. The wine offers citrus, green herb and fresh kiwi aromas.",Tasca d'Almerita 2009 Sallier de la Tour Grillo (Sicilia)
"While savory on the nose, with hints of mealy apple and chalk dust, the palate of this vibrant, light-bodied Pinot Gris exposes a range of delicate wildflower and lime zest notes, punctuated by snappy acidity and a brisk, clean mouthfeel. Drink now.",Thirsty Owl Wine Company 2010 Pinot Gris (Finger Lakes)
"Yes, a certain amount of acidity is desirable in Australian Riesling, but this one is exceedingly lean and crisp. Perhaps it will blossom with age, but for now it is simply intensely citrusy and rather skinny. Pair it with oysters, or put it in a cool dark place and hope for the best.",Château Tanunda 2010 Grand Barossa Riesling (Barossa)
"Light on the nose, with a hint of apple and lime. Feels scouring, with sour-apple acidity and juicy but narrow flavors of white citrus and pineapple. Tangy but limited in flavor. Will work best as a palate-prepping or cleansing wash.",Cornellana 2011 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Cachapoal Valley)
"The wine that first introduced Americans to Sicily, this classic Corvo blend offers a light, bright appearance followed by easy tones of red berry, bitter almond and cassis.",Corvo 2008 Red (Sicilia)
Corvo Bianco is a tried and true white wine that helped introduce Sicilian wines to international markets. It's worth revisiting this wine if you are looking for something fresh to wash down seafood.,Corvo 2010 Bianco White (Sicilia)
"Made from organically-farmed Nerello Mascalese, this simple wine does show true varietal characteristics of wild fruit, dark mineral and cola. The aromas are mild and the mouthfeel delivers medium intensity.",Di Giovanna 2009 Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia)
"A rounded wine that is soft and fruity, the flavors edged with toast. There is an attractive citrus flavor that gives some crispness to what feels a fat wine. Drink now.",Domaine Marc Jambon 2009 Cuvée Fût de Chêne  (Mâcon-Pierreclos)
"This version of Calanìca (made from 60% Frappato and 40% Syrah) offers a low impact bouquet of earthy forest fruit and bramble. It's a light, lean wine with a touch of soft spice on the close.",Duca di Salaparuta 2009 Calanìca Frappato-Syrah Red (Sicilia)
"Shows the acidity and dryness that red wines from this appellation always have. It's Pinot Noir-esque in the silky texture and cola flavors, and is ready to drink now.",Hangtime 2010 Force Canyon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)
"Almost garnet red in color, this off-dry Pinot Noir sparkling packs a punch with an abundance of juicy black cherry and plum flavor. Concentrated but festive and fun, with a candy-coated cherry finish.",Hosmer NV Brut Rosé Pinot Noir (Cayuga Lake)
"Made from native Cayuga grapes, this softly pétillant sparkler is pleasantly frothy, and features brisk, lemony acidity. Just a shade sweeter than brut, it's fruity and forward, with ample stone-fruit and blossom notes. Finishes with a dainty lacing of sugar. Drink now.",Hosmer NV Sparkling Wine Sparkling (New York)
"Shows dark fruit aromas and raisin on the nose, feels fresh, zesty and edgy, with a bright mix of cherry, berry and mild spice flavors. Feels pretty good and offers a reasonably solid and long finish for a $6 red.",J. Garcia Carrion 2010 Opera Prima Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"There's a hint of caramelized sugar on the nose of this off-dry Gewürztraminer that gives an edge to all the succulent sweet pear nectar and apple blossoms notes that permeate the palate. Elegantly floral, it finishes with a touch of characteristic orange and clove spice.",Knapp 2010 Sunrise Hill Vineyard Semi-Dry Gewürztraminer (Cayuga Lake)
"Sharp acidity and even some tannins mark this simple Chardonnay. In its favor are savory green apple, peach and lime flavors, with creamy, oaky notes.",Markham 2010 Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"The perfumes of Malvasia Fina shine in this attractive dry sparkling wine. It is fruity, although with a yeasty edge, creating a fine apéritif style.",Murganheira 2005 Bruto Sparkling (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade)
"Sweet and fizzy, with orange soda and vanilla flavors. Made to appeal to serve the low-cost Moscato craze, and does a pretty good job.",Allure NV Moscato (California)
"The family-owned, Santa Lucia Highlands-focused Wrath Winery produces their Ex Anima line to show off wines from their estate San Saba Vineyard made with very little intervention and no new oak. This wine is nearly as clear as water, and yet offers aromas or freshly cut grass, honeydew melon, kiwi and fresh rain on rocks. On the palate, minerality lingers alongside poached pear and peach. Refreshing and light, yet full of flavor.",Wrath 2013 Ex Anima Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey)
"Aged in 100% new French oak, this dark and muscular wine has lush scents of cut tobacco and dense cassis fruit. Black olive highlights bring a nice herbal element to the mix. The tannins, though quite astringent, are ripe and balanced.",Adams Bench 2010 the V Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is actually Wahluke Slope fruit, though labeled simply Columbia Valley. Tart pomegranate fruit, a seam of clay and well-integrated highlights of herb and earth mark this extremely limited-production wine as special. Dolcetto does not have much of a track record in Washington, but what's here is quite promising.",Animale 2011 Dolcetto (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Sea salt and lemon rind start this refreshing white. Flavors of citrus, mineral and brine on the finish are balanced and bright. A lovely wine and a great pairing for grilled octopus, sushi or poultry.",Argyros 2013 Assyrtiko (Santorini)
"Toasty aromas include popcorn, scrambled egg and briny white fruits. There's smoothness to the ripe palate, while apple, peach and citrus flavors—the Big Three of cava—finish fruity and with stuffing. This is a ripe winner that's richer and more flavorful than your average brut nature.",Castellroig 2009 Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)
"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime.",Testarossa 2012 Sierra Madre Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Raspberry, spicebox and cinnamon aromas start this modern-style Xinomavro. Lively acidity and a good tannic structure balance the cherry fruit. A great introduction to the variety.",Thymiopoulos 2012 Young Vines Xinomavro (Naoussa)
"Sourced entirely from the Chelle den Millie vineyard, the grapes were picked and processed specifically for rosé. A deep, delicious and rather potent summer wine, it captures the brisk cherry fruit without entangling it in too much tannin or herb. It's all about the fruit, and bravo for that.",Va Piano 2013 Rosé of Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
Layers of wood and yellow fruits are already well balanced in this ripe while crisp wine. A steely texture balances the fruit to give a wine that is structured while offering the potential of a more opulent future. Drink from 2015.,Jean-Claude Debeaune 2012  Pouilly-Fuissé
"In this powerful, full-bodied wine, soft fruit accompanies the firm tannins. The wine is already well integrated, showing dense red fruits as well as structure. A touch of wood will soften soon. Drink from 2016.",Louis Latour 2011 Morgeot Premier Cru  (Chassagne-Montrachet)
"It's almost absurd how good this $9 Tempranillo is. Full, clean, deep aromas of black fruits and licorice feed into an energetic yet generous palate with moderate richness. Flavors of black cherry, blackberry and pepper finish spicy but not pushy. What a deal!",Mano A Mano 2011 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"From a dark bottle, this salmon-colored rosé is medium-bodied and made in a bigger style than many others. Fully textured, it discloses flavorful touches of crunchy pear and cranberry. It would go well with a goat cheese salad adorned in dried cranberries and cherries.",Ousterhout 2013 800 Vines Vineyard Rosé of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Aromas of cherry, raspberry and buttered toast set the scene for a wine whose flavors of Bing cherry, custard, clove and fennel are bright on entry before pleasantly washing across the side palate. Unified fruit and spice flavors endure on the taste buds into the smooth, drawn out finish.",Suvla 2011 Reserve Single Vineyard Bozokbag Cabernet Sauvignon (Thrace)
"This structured blend of 50% Nero d'Avola, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, mature black fruit and exotic spice. The palate boasts polished tannins as well as flavors of ripe blackberry, red currant, grilled pepper and a hint of cocoa.",Ceuso 2009 Red (Sicilia)
"Smoothly seductive in bright red-berry and pomegranate fruit, this young Zinfandel comes from mostly Dry Creek Valley vineyards. Rippling in baking spice and subtle vanilla oak, it's a complete wine, with balanced acidity and mellowed tannins. Clean and long on the finish, it will complement rather than overpower a meal.",Decoy 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)
"From 100% estate-grown fruit, it spent more than a year in 100% French oak and is dense in baked strawberry, black cherry and a richness of herb. The grip of fruit is balanced by moderate acidity. The grapes are organically certified.",Domaine Carneros 2011 La Terre Promise Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Full of bright yellow fruits, this is ripe, rounded and already delicious. Rich mango and peach flavors contribute an exotic edge to the more mineral texture. Drink now.",Domaine La Soufrandise 2012 Vieilles Vignes  (Pouilly-Fuissé)
"Loamy, earthy blackberry and plum aromas are woody and attractive. This is loud and lively on the palate, with acidity and tannins making their presence felt. Blackberry and baked plum are the key flavors, and this finishes loamy and smooth. Drink through 2018.",Finca La Mata 2011  Ribera del Duero
"Made from a blend of 60% Alicante, 30% Nocera and 10% Calabrese, this wine has aromas of violet, tilled earth, mature plum, prune and black cooking spice. The soft, savory palate delivers ripe black cherry and black berry, accented by black pepper and nutmeg. It's balanced, with velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Made for early drinking pleasure, so enjoy soon.",Hauner 2012 Hierà Red (Salina)
"Notes of grass, green pepper and citrus on the nose are followed by a combination of steely minerality and plump grapefruit on the palate in this sophisticated wine. Zippy but substantial, it will pair well with foods like oysters or grilled fish.",Mulderbosch 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"At a time when many others have dropped Sangiovese from their portfolios, Amador Foothill remains committed to the great grape of Tuscany. The wine is medium-bodied and soft, somewhat like a warm-climate Merlot, with a pepper edge to the cherry and red currant flavors. It finishes dry and elegant.",Amador Foothill Winery 2005 Estate Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA))
"This Cabernet-Merlot blend is definitely dominated by spice that takes shape as cumin, turmeric and ground clove. The fruit is present, although there's not much, in the form of mature plum and dried prunes. The wine tastes ripe, slightly sweet and is a bit short on the finish.",Antonino Tringali-Casanuova 2004 Patrimonio  (Bolgheri)
"Full, rounded and creamy, this is a fine, green plum- and white berry-flavored wine that has some good depth as well as fine floral aromas. It is lively and fresh, but with some richness.",Château Toumilon 2005  Graves
"Courtney Benham, a brand from Martin Ray, does a good, consistent job with their Sauvignon Blanc, at a fair price. The '06, like its predecessors, is dry and crisp, with succulent flavors of limes, pineapples, sweet green peas, figs and spicy vanilla. This is a good price for a wine of such sophistication.",Courtney Benham 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"Flavors of bright, ripe black currant fruit and a nose of cinnamon, anise and blackberry recommend this energetic wine from the Wellington region. Slightly rustic but still restrained and elegant, the wine will pair well with grilled meat and a myriad of cheeses.",Eventide Cellar 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Wellington)
"It hasn't all come together yet in this young wine, and it's hard to predict where it's going. Fresh and juvenile, it shows ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit, with some hard-edged tannins and a bitterness in the finish. Could come together, but the absence of prior vintages makes it a guessing game.",Bonneau 2005 Epos Meritage (Napa Valley)
"For a basic Tempranillo from Rueda, there's nothing not to like about this wine. It's snappy and fresh, maybe a bit sharp, but not spiky. The flavors are of berry and cherry, and the feel is tight but solid, with some juicy depth. Drink it like you might Beaujolais.",Valsanzo 2005 Viña Sanzo Tempranillo (Rueda)
"Black currant and cherry flavors, accented with a touch of smoky oak, mark this dry, smooth wine. It has the textural hallmarks of the best of Napa Valley Cabernet, but lacks the richness. Drink now.",Hunter Ashby 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Gentle and candy ripe, this Cab has pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, red plums, licorice and chocolate, accented with toasty, spicy oak, wrapped into sweet, fine tannins. Too soft for the cellar, so drink up.",Nicholls 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"A perfect summer wine, this Sauvignon Blanc offers a combination of cheerful citrus and fruit and a flinty minerality that keep it dry and clean on the palate. Paired with seafood, it's even better.",Southern Right 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Walker Bay)
"Here's a straightforward Chardonnay, with potent fruit and the crisp acidity of this cool, coastal region. The flavors are pure Meyer lemon, lime zest and tangy mineral.",Stephen Ross 2006 Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend. However, in the mouth the wine is more expressive and ripe, with plum, berry and ample oak-driven vanilla. It doesn't appear to have much depth or complexity, but overall it is smooth and pleasant.",Pago de Larrainzar 2005 Red (Navarra)
"Fairly ripe and deep smelling, yet it's more racy and lean in the mouth. There's good berry fruit to this Tempranillo-led wine, but it turns kind of sharp and sheering on the back palate. Freshness and snappy zest are the wine's main characteristics. Probably best with tapas.",Pago de los Capellanes 2006 Joven Roble  (Ribera del Duero)
"A rich, stately nose announces the elegance of this Merlot from the consistently poised Vergelegen. Balanced flavors of berry and spice and smooth, subtle tannins give the wine additional class. Drinkable now, but the wine could easily age.",Vergelegen 2004 Merlot (Stellenbosch)
"This blend of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is light and leafy but not dirty or harsh. It's a thin-sided, tangy sort of wine with as much citrus as there is berry fruit. For something aged and mild, it's pretty good but not what you'd call substantial. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.",Viña Albali 1998 Gran Reserva de Familia Red (Valdepeñas)
"Light in color and body, this is a silky Pinot Noir for everyday fare. It shows cola, cherry jam, persimmon and Asian spice flavors, with a coating of toasty oak.",Judd's Hill 2006 Estate Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"This is overpowering, almost too much. The fruit is so rich it feels overextracted, superjuicy and then hit with tannins and new wood. For those who like superconcentrated wines, this will be a big hit, but not with food.",L'Egrégoire 2004  Bordeaux
"Dark, soft, full-bodied and slightly sweet, this Pinot clearly shows its warm-climate origins. It tastes of jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries.",Loring Wine Company 2006 Russell Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Paso Robles)
"This Sauvignon Blanc offers more weight and earthiness for fans of whites that steer away from lean, grassy flavors. Simply elegant and food-friendly, the wine has a balanced character and while still refreshing, has soul.",Old Well House 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"This medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts a fair degree of complexity for its modest tariff: slightly toasty, nutty aromas lead into flavors of hazelnut, ripe peach and citrus. A solid effort.",De Bortoli 2007 Deen de Bortoli Vat 7 Chardonnay (South Eastern Australia)
"Plump and sweet, this corpulent kabinett features aromas and flavors of honey, tangerine and melon, with just the vaguest hints of slatey minerality. A hint of bitterness on the finish helps balanace some of the weight and sugar. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Thanisch) 2006 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"You can't beat the price of this simple, quaffable red from Oak Lane, and certainly this is a wine that could make for very nice everyday sipping. A nose of wood spice and berry unfolds into flavors of toasted oak, bright berry and pepper. Though a bit one-dimensional, the wine offers structure and style.",Beau Joubert 2006 Oak Lane Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon (Stellenbosch)
"A solid combination of Chenin's curvy, honeyed flavors and the clean crispness of Sauvignon Blanc. An affordable, dependable wine with a go-to personality for everyday enjoyment.",Beau Joubert 2007 Oak Lane Chenin Blanc - Sauvignon Blanc White (Stellenbosch)
"Pretty nice for a lean, more traditional Rioja crianza. The palate is clean and tangy, with strawberry, raspberry and citrusy flavors. Freshness is this wine's middle name. It's old-school, so don't look for a lot of color, body or sweetness.",Bodegas Franco-Españolas 2003 Rioja Bordón Crianza  (Rioja)
"The nose blends overtly floral, fruity lead aromas with secondary notes of shoe polish and leather, but in the end it's a little mute. The mouth offers standard plum and berry flavors, while the mouthfeel is chunky and generally quite pure. This is not a thoroughbred, but it's more than a good plow horse.",Bodegas Leza García 2001 Arderius Reserva  (Rioja)
"This is an attractive, crisp and fruity wine. It has layers of wood that are already integrating well with the black-currant fruitiness. Tannins and a firm core are signs that the wine will age well. Drink this attractive wine from 2018.",Bernard Magrez 2014 Château Tour Blanche  (Médoc)
"Relatively light for the variety, this wine has lots of tasty, almost jammy fruit flavors, medium tannins and a smooth but gripping texture. It's very good to drink now.",Boatique 2014 Petite Sirah (Red Hills Lake County)
"A barrel-fermented wine, this is richly perfumed both from the wood and from the nature of the Cercial grape. The wine has strong minerality, lime and lemon flavors, and layers of spice. Already mature, the wine is ready to drink.",Campolargo 2014 Campolargo Branco White (Bairrada)
"Well-aged, light gold, and bottled in a Burgundy bottle for reasons unknown, this off dry high-acid effort should be consumed within the next year or two. The apple fruit has moved into secondary (baked) flavors, with a tart kick to the finish suggesting that the acids may soon outstrip the fruit.",Cerulean 2010 Underwood Mountain Riesling (Columbia Gorge (WA))
"This wine opens with just a touch of reduction followed by quite pure aromas of red and blue fruit. The flavors are sweet and fresh, with the tannins bringing a light grip.",Charles Smith 2014 The Velvet Devil Merlot (Washington)
"From vines on the plain of Saint-Émilion, close to the Dordogne river, this is a ripe fruity wine. The tannins are already well integrated into the berry fruits, leaving just a dry core that is typical of the year. Drink the wine from 2018.",Château Abelyce 2011  Saint-Émilion
"On the slopes above the eastern Bordeaux town of Sainte-Foy, this vineyard produces some fine wines. Aged in new wood, the wine is rich in tannins, complex and serious. Bright red fruits and a firm structure both promise aging. Drink from 2018.",Château Bellevue Peycharneau 2013  Sainte-Foy Bordeaux
"A light wood-aging flavor gives this wine its richness along with its fine ripe yellow fruits. Ripe and fruity from an excellent year for white Bordeaux, the wine is smooth and ready to drink.",Château Haut Bertinerie 2014 Elegance  (Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux)
"The second wine of Château le Prieuré, made from 100% pure juicy Merlot, is ripe and concentrated. It still has plenty of firm tannins although the rich fruits will balance out shortly. It is then going to be a generous wine with great final fruitiness. Drink from 2018.",Château le Prieuré 2014 Délice du Prieuré  (Saint-Émilion)
"A dense wine that is showing signs of heavy extraction, with dark chocolate and bitter flavors. In a vintage with crisp fruitiness being the defining factor, it is a bit of a shame. The dark edge needs to mellow before the wine can balance out.",Château Marquis de Terme 2014  Margaux
"The wine is firm and structured, showing more structure than fruit. It is solid, tight and with vanilla and blackberry fruits that are still behind the tannins. Probably this wine will remain firm, although the tannins should soften. Drink from 2018.",Château Moncets 2011  Lalande de Pomerol
"A blend that is 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon has produced a ripe, juicy and fruity wine, typical of the vintage. There is a crisp edge as well as firmer tannins and signs of the wood aging that will integrate as the wine matures. Drink this attractive wine from 2019.",Château Moulin de Blanchon 2014  Haut-Médoc
"The 49% of Sémillon in this rich wine gives it a full, ripe character. It is backed up by the more herbal Sauvignon Blanc to add the freshness. The wine is fruity with citrus and white stone fruits, ready to drink from 2017.",Clarendelle 2015  Bordeaux Blanc
"Tons of candied grape and lilac aromas show on the nose of this rather aged blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre, with root beer and blueberry-sorbet notes. The palate offers a similar array of sweet dark fruit, but the tannic structure and acidity clean it up nicely.",DENO 2008 Paso Rouge Alto Pomar Vineyard Estate G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Organically grown grapes went into this perfumed wine. It is fruity, crisp with bright cherry flavors and lifted with acidity. The wine is still developing, still bringing its tannins to the fore. Drink from 2018.",Domaine de la Bonne Tonne 2014 Côte de Py  (Morgon)
"This wine is ripe with acidity and red-berry fruits, with firm tannins that will soften. Drink this attractive, fruity wine from 2019.",Quevedo 2014 Claudia's Red (Douro)
"While this wine is dry, it offers good fruit weight that will fill out as it matures. It has a smoky character with juicy red-berry fruits in the background. Drink from 2020.",Quinta Nova de Nossa Senhora do Carmo 2014 Reserva Unoaked Red (Douro)
"Light aromas of red cherry and cranberry meet with thyme and wild herbs on the reserved nose of this appellation blend. It's energetic and light on the palate, where thyme, marjoram and cedar flavors dominate the red fruit.",Sextant 2014 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Off dry, fresh and lightly spritzy, this appealing wine brings flavors of lemon tea front and center. The aromatics hint at honeysuckle and orange blossom, and the finish is pleasantly granular, with a sweet, sugary edge.",Sweet Cheeks 2015 Riesling (Oregon)
"Coming from a site best known for its Syrah, this wine offers aromas of berry compote, funk and potpourri. The palate shows a pleasing sense of purity, with lightly astringent tannins providing a bit of distraction.",Telaya 2014 Boushey Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"Wisps of smoke and honeycomb thread enticingly amidst fresh lemon and lime in this nimble-footed dry Riesling. Lean and rather linear in style, its penetrating citrus flavors are bolstered by an invigorating streak of acidity. The finish is zesty and bold.",Von Schleinitz 2015 Nitor Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"This is an earthy, stemmy wine, hugely concentrated and ripe in strawberry and rhubarb. Subtle in texture and bite, it shows a streak of cardamom on the finish.",Winc 2014 Porter and Plot Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"The 2015 Estate Chardonnay is a fruit-foward wine, offering bright pineapple and citrus flavors that reverberate on the refreshing finish. On the whole, it is straightforward, with an approachable texture.",Kooyong 2015 Estate Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)
"The vines around Chiroubles are some of the highest in Beaujolais. That gives wines with a structure, although here, this structure has been lost in the heavy fruit. It is very full, rich and with black-cherry flavors. Drink from 2017.",L. Tramier & Fils 2015 Collection  (Chiroubles)
"The Laurelwood offers sharp flavors of pine tar, threaded through fresh fruit. Apple and orange are there in abundance, and the piny accents will be an interesting highlight for some tasters, but a distraction for others.",Laurelwood 2015 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Produced with organically grown grapes, the wine is firm, still tight and with ripe black fruits. It is full, structured with enough fruitiness to balance the tannins. As it ages, this wine will come together into a rich while fruity wine. Drink from late 2017.",Lion des Aubrots 2014  Côtes de Bourg
"Aromas of oak, coconut, blue flower and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose. The linear palate is on the lean side, offering tart red cherry, raspberry, anise and oak-driven spice alongside fine-grained tannins and firm acidity.",Mamete Prevostini 2014 Sassella  (Valtellina Superiore)
"This is a solidly tannic wine. A dry edge comes from the Baga grape in the blend. At the same time, the wine has plenty of ripe black fruits that give a rounder character. The wine is ready to drink, although it will be better from late 2017.",Messias 2012 Quinta do Valdoeiro Colheita Red (Bairrada)
"Vibrant aromas of lychee, white flowers and spice give way to off-dry fruit flavors, with the concentration seeming a bit light. Still, it delivers a lot of appeal.",Pacific Rim 2015 Twin Vineyards Gewürztraminer (Yakima Valley)
"Extremely rocky and dusty aromas of turned earth and tobacco meet with snapped dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a little-known region 30 miles inland from the Monterey Bay. Espresso bean and black plums show on the impressively dark palate that is well structured, finishing on slight hints of roasted pepper and peppercorns.",Donati 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paicines)
"Juicy in smoked cherry and a thick, velvety texture, this luxuriously pretty wine blends several estate blocks and clones. Forest floor, cola, clove, pine and black cherry highlight an integrated approach. It stays balanced and complex through a lengthy finish that further accentuates the spice.",Iron Horse 2014 Estate Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Almost confected, candied notions of red berry appear on the nose. The palate tones these down and comes in with a smooth, rounded and ripe body. Alcoholic power becomes evident on the finish, as does a fine-meshed tannic structure. This is a plush but elegant Pinot Noir with just a little spice.",Jalits 2015 Pinot Noir (Burgenland)
"Super earthy, this wine shows pomegranate, rhubarb and a touch of smoke, the aromas perfumed in rose petal. Medium bodied, it's balanced and elegant, with a streak of natural, lifted acidity.",Levendi 2014 Charisma Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"Caramel-laced buttercream, marshmallow, cotton candy and sweet almond milk show on the nose of this bottling, named after one of Bill Foley's daughters. It's fairly light in body on the sprightly palate, where burnt marshmallow and vanilla flavors reign over the citrus elements.",Lincourt 2014 Courtney's Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This mouthfilling wine is generously ripe and rich, with hints of herb and mountain brush dancing around soft, rounded layers of plum and cinnamon. The finish is lush and lingering.",Luna 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The nose is very shy, giving little away apart from slight citrus. Everything happens on the palate, with tender but ripe pear fruit gently edged with zesty citrus. A tingle of white pepper along the lemon peel creates a vividly fresh but light wine. It's clean and totally refreshing, with a long finish.",Markus Huber 2016 Terrassen Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"Lemon and lime are just hinted at on the restrained nose. On the palate they are joined by friendly, juicy stone-fruit notes of ripe yellow Mirabelle plum. The palate is dry, light and juicy, with a delicate stature that leads to a zesty citrus finish.",Markus Huber 2016 Terrassen Riesling (Traisental)
"Cabernet Sauvignon (54%) takes the lead on this blend, followed by Merlot (23%), Cabernet Franc (13%), Malbec (6%) and Petit Verdot. Aromas of fresh herb, flower, pencil lead, cherry jam and spice lead to light tart, fresh fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip and dryness that hopefully smooths out with some additional time in the bottle but it has the stuffing to go the distance.",Matthews 2014 Claret Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Brawny in tannin weight and grip, this tight-knit wine is impressively built and in tune with the vintage and its embrace of strength and complexity. Chalky texture is highlighted in tart mountain cherry, graphite and vanilla laced in clove. Enjoy best 2023–2033.",Michael Mondavi Family Estate 2013 Animo Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"One of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters, the aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of lees, almond, melted butter, cream, peach and spice. All Clone 95, the tropical-fruit flavors are sweet, rich and layered. A touch of heat on the finish is the only thing that holds it back.",Morell-Peña 2015 Amylla Loren Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Exotic spice, vanilla, dark-skinned fruit and French oak aromas lift out of the glass. The palate shows toasted oak, coconut, espresso raspberry and cherry alongside tight close-grained tannins that grip the austere finish. It's still on its oak so give it time to come around. Drink after 2023.",Parusso 2013 Bussia  (Barolo)
"This wine is sourced from multiple sites across the appellation, including Rochioli, Mill Station and Laughlin Road, all of the vineyards relatively cool. Light and mineral-driven, the wine presents as crisp and subtle in oak, allowing for exotic fruit and floral elements to show and a richness to develop slowly toward the finish.",Ramey 2014 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), Merlot (26%) and Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically expressive, with notes of raspberry, cigar box, mint, café au lait, blackberry, dried herb, anise and wet gravel. The palate displays a sense of elegance and refinement that captures the attention, with red-fruit flavors lingering on the long (slightly warm) finish.",Rasa 2013 Fianchetto Xl Vineyard Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is a single vineyard, 100% varietal wine, aged in 70% new French oak. It draws you into the glass, with notes of char, fig, blackberry, spice and coffee. The dark-roasted coffee and dark-fruit flavors show precision and detail, lingering on the finish. The wood is primary at present but should integrate with time.",Rasa 2014 For the Love of the Game Cabernet Sauvignon (Horse Heaven Hills)
"Light and spicy, this wine surprises and delights. It shows a tannic underbrush of firmness and grit that's seasoned in tart acidity and flavors of rhubarb, currant and black tea. It's well balanced and enjoyable now.",Ron Rubin 2014 Gunsalus Vineyard Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Floral and fleshy, this is a big-boned, concentrated wine. A ripe rendering of apple, pear and peach is spiked in intriguing seasonings of lemongrass and nutmeg.",Saintsbury 2015 Sangiacomo Green Acres Catarina Clone 4 Chardonnay (Carneros)
Floral and wet-stone aromas are followed by tangy kiwi and jicama flavors keeping to a nicely dry profile. This distinctive wine from extremely consistent Saracina has bracing acidity and good concentration but remains on the subtle side.,Saracina 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendocino County)
"This wine is a blend of fruit from Boushey, Bacchus, The Benches and Candy Mountain vineyards. Very primary aromas of smoke, toast, char and cherry are followed by sumptuous fruit and barrel flavors. The oak seems a little heavy handed at times but it still brings a lot of appeal.",Sequel 2014 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The merest touch of peach and Golden Delicious apple plays on the nose. The palate features lively lemon notes on a very slender, brisk and fresh palate, along with a tiny bit of spritz. It shows a depth of fruit: a wine for lovers of subtlety. The crisp apple-peel finish is totally moreish.",Stadlmann 2016 Anning Weissburgunder (Thermenregion)
"High-toned aromas of blackberry, aniseed, macerated cranberry, motor oil and flower lead to rich full-bodied cranberry and blackberry flavors that bring a sense of hedonism.",Stevens 2014 StevensBlackTongue Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Fruity hints of blueberry pie on the nose are juicy, ripe and enticing. The palate has the same generous fruit, joined by forest elements. It's a fruit-driven, juicy and ripe wine with a fresh counterpoint, a slight grip and a spicy finish.",Stift Klosterneuburg 2015 Blaufränkisch (Thermenregion)
"This blend of 45% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Freisa is very approachable and food-friendly, showing baked black-cherry pie, star anise and pine resin on the nose. The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured.",Toccata 2013 Classico Red (Santa Barbara County)
"Both tropical and herbal notes join the citrus flavors on the nose, hinting of passion fruit as well as mint. The palate tones this down and puts ripe lemon in the spotlight. Sleek and slender, the body has a creamy element of yeast but is dry and brisk. The finish is very balanced and lasting.",Türk 2016 Kremser Weinberge Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Ripe notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The richness of the fruit is also apparent on the fleshy palate, where cherry notes fill out into red and black juiciness, with just a touch of the variety's telltale pepper. This wine is almost bouncy and reveals its firm grip and freshness only on the finish that echoes long.",Umathum 2015 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"Delicate notes of nettle and lemon play on the restrained nose. The palate adds slight but very refreshing spritz to the already slender and crisp body. This is an easy, delicate summer wine with a clean and refreshing finish.",Umathum 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Burgenland)
"This is rich, honeyed and ripe on the nose and full-bodied and round in the mouth, with just enough acidity to provide backbone and length. The peach, melon and citrus notes linger on the mouthwatering finish.",Ferraton Pere et Fils 2014 Les Miaux Marsanne (Hermitage)
"A blend of 74% Syrah, 10% Carignan, 6% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 4% Cinsault, this is an elegant and harmonious wine. It showcases a masterful balance between lush, ripe black berry fruits and earthy, toasty spice. With its crushed-velvet texture, bold fruit flavors and lingering spice accents, the wine is easy to appreciate and enjoy now, yet structured enough to age well for another 6–10 years.",Mas Champart 2013 Causse du Bousquet Red (Saint-Chinian)
"Earthy aromas of olive, tobacco, prune and oak set up a palate with drawing tannins. This tastes of coffee, mocha and earthy mixed berries. The finish is meaty in texture, with compatible oak spice and berry-fruit notes.",Sonsierra 2010 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Smooth, silky and ready to drink, this medium- to full-bodied wine is a fine choice to go with nearly any red-meat dish. Hints of smoke and herb dress up the dark berry flavors, finishing with mouthwatering acidity.",Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Vieilles Vignes  (Crozes-Hermitage)
"This is the third of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters. The aromas bring notes of clarified butter, lees, spice, pear, pineapple and other tropical fruit. The flavors are rich but still show restraint, with a lightly creamy feel and a long finish.",Morell-Peña 2015 Gemma Camaryn Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Willow Creek district winery delivers a powerful blend of 71% Grenache, 19% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Viognier. It offers aromas of black licorice, black cherry and elderberry, with roasted meat in the background. It's very rich, bursting with flavors of blackberry and balsamic vinegar that evolve toward creosote and tar, all wrapped up in silky tannins.",Jada Vineyard & Winery 2012 WCS Jack John Red (Paso Robles)
"Essentially a Bordeaux-style blend (just 4% Syrah breaks the mold), this smooth, silky wine is seductive. The blueberry, black cherry and plum fruit has compelling complexity, further enhanced with flavors of coffee and toast from 14 months in French oak.",Laughing Stock 2011 LFNG Blind Trust Red (Okanagan Valley)
"Grassy hints mingle with riper yellow pear notions. The palate turns out to be tenderly pear-fruited, with a core of warm ripeness and a slender, soft footprint of pear fruit salad. Incredibly elegant and fine-boned, notwithstanding its definition.",Leth 2013 Scheiben Roter Veltliner (Wagram-Donauland)
"Smooth and delicious, this opens with aromas of violet, mature dark fruit, leather and a touch of menthol. The palate delivers dried black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and licorice alongside polished tannins. It's already accessible but will also age well for another five or six years. Drink through 2020.",Manzone Fratelli 2009 Vigna Fraschin  (Barolo)
"Very soft notions of ripe, yellow pear with floral overtones create a softer, luscious but completely dry palate. An ideal wine for those who like structure but mellow flavors. The savory edge of Grüner makes itself felt around the edges but never dominates and provides spicy length.",Markus Huber 2013 Berg Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Traisental)
"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.",Michael Gill Cellars 2012 Black Tie Syrah (Paso Robles)
"Aromas suggest ripe blackberry, baking spice, mocha and a balsamic note of menthol. The brooding palate opens with mature black cherry, savory herb and black pepper alongside tightly knit but velvety tannins that still need to unwind. Drink 2016–2021.",Ca' Viola 2009 Sottocastello di Novello  (Barolo)
"This wine starts off a bit tarry at first, with scents of asphalt and roasted meat that then give way to brighter notes of blackberry and vanilla. On the palate, it's full, supple and rich, with a finish marked by hints of campfire and cherry.",D'Arenberg 2010 The Blind Tiger Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"This perfumey white dances in intense and creamy layers of stone fruit and vanilla, remaining vibrant and balanced from start to finish. The generous fruit is grown in the relatively cooler Oak Knoll section of the Napa Valley. This should develop further over time and in the glass.",Darioush 2013 Viognier (Napa Valley)
Inviting notes of ripe yellow plum and a mossy creaminess on nose and palate combine to great effect. Peppery watercress notes provide extra interest. The spiciness persists for a long time in this beautifully balanced wine.,Dürnberg 2013 Endlos Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"Produced only in good years, this wine comes from selected parcels in the Haute-Serre vineyard. With eucalyptus perfumes, it is a smooth and wood-aged wine. The smoothness masks the powerful tannins that are beginning to balance with the rich black fruits. This dense wine needs to age. Drink from 2019.",Georges Vigouroux 2011 Château de Haute-Serre Cuvée Prestige Malbec (Cahors)
"Light golden brown in color, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of brown sugar, dried pineapple, papaya and lychee. A whopping 270.8g/L residual sugar, it's thick, honeyed and sugary sweet with cinnamon, honey and granulated brown sugar flavors that linger on the finish.",Gordon Estate 2012 Estate Grown Late Harvest Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Alluring aromas of blue flower, leather, menthol, dark berry, baking spice and a balsamic note lead the way on this full-bodied, elegant red. The palate doles out ripe black cherry, while notes of clove, white pepper, tobacco, sage and licorice add depth. It's nicely balanced with firm, ripe tannins. Drink through 2023.",Prinsi 2008 Fausoni Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Despite being barrel fermented, this attractive white manages to maintain a vivid vibrancy and freshness, with notes of fresh red apple, firm peach, pineapple core, green mango and clementine that are all infused with delicate hints of toasted oak and baking spice. Ample acidity lifts the medium-weight palate and rich melon, apple and toasted brioche flavors, leading into the long, lingering wood-spiced finish.",Jardin 2012 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)
"Lightly hued and luminous, this offers aromas of dried rose petal, red berry and a whiff of baking spice. The elegant palate delivers wild strawberry, red raspberry, wild cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside silky tannins. It shows a more subtle and delicate side to Barolo. Drink through 2024.",Mascarello Giuseppe e Figlio 2009 Villero  (Barolo)
"This is still closed tightly and barely wants to give away more than punchy grapefruit zest, but the balanced palate that cushions the fresh but ripe acidity suggests that this will open up gradually. Drink as of 2017.",Alzinger 2013 Steinertal Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Subtle but unmistakable white pepper flashes through this slender, lemony but oh-so-savory wine. Notions of ripe pear enter on the midpalate which comes across as complete, harmonious and long.",Anton Bauer 2013 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Wagram)
"Savory hints of bay and an inviting, lively pepperiness lend verve to this cherry-laden red. Somehow the fruit willingly shares the limelight with spicy, herbal notes and is all the more charming for it. This is ripe and rounded but not heavy and thus quite irresistible, with a moreish, lingering aftertaste.",Arndorfer 2012 Die Leidenschaft Zweigelt (Niederösterreich)
"Pepper rules this cool-climate, low-alcohol take on the grape by Doug Margerum, with both white and black pepper giving spice to blackened beef and blackberry fruits. The rich yet tart flavors trend toward boysenberry, with dried oregano and basil apparent alongside the very prominent cracked peppercorns.",Barden 2012 Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine dazzles the senses with notes of freshly roasted coffee, char, dark plum and sweet spices. It's medium bodied with thoroughly delicious coffee flavors backed by a soft feel.",J & J 2012 Les Collines Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Yeasty, almost umami-like spice slowly yields to ripe, delicious apricot flavors. The generosity is toned by bright lemon freshness that runs right through this concentrated wine and provides satisfying length. There is a delicious aftertaste of crunchy apple.",Jurtschitsch 2013 Heiligenstein Alte Reben Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)
"Soft, delicate pear and gentle citrus coalesce into a more citrus-focused, super-fresh palate with verve and elegance. Light-footed but concentrated, this is graceful, with wonderful minerality.",Unger 2013 Gottschelle Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This bottling is consistently among the best Margaret River Chardonnays, and the 2013 doesn't disappoint. Subtle notes of grilled peach and pineapple slices are carried by ample weight and richness on the midpalate, then gain focus and fold in citrus flavors on the long finish.",Vasse Felix 2013 Heytesbury Chardonnay (Margaret River)
"This unique, port-style dessert wine fortifies its Marechal Foch, Cabernet Franc and Merlot base with walnut brandy. Smooth as silk, it has clearly benefitted from extra bottle age, and drinks like a dream. It's loaded with lush and generous flavors of crème de cassis, toffee, coffee, maple syrup and caramel.",Vista d'Oro 2007 D'Oro Red (Okanagan Valley)
"This is an exclamation point of a wine. The fruit pops with pure notes of black and red plum along with herbs and milk chocolate. It's fresh and fruit-filled, with an elegant, palate-coating texture that simply dazzles the senses.",Walla Walla Vintners 2012 Dolcetto (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Blended with 12% Grenache and 8% Roussanne, this direct and appealing wine suggests violets, raspberries and plum, with a vanilla top note (21% new American oak). The coffee and blue fruit flavors are rich and full, with vanilla notes lingering on the finish. It's a complete knockout for this price.",Waterbrook 2012 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
Here's a ruby-colored Rosso from Montalcino with fresh berry aromas and subtle tones of forest underbrush and exotic spice. There are hints of cherry and vanilla as well and the wine is fruity and genuine in the mouth.,Col d'Orcia 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"A delicious citric-dominated wine, very fresh, with a great apple skin texture, bright aciidty and crisp white fruits. It dances easily, lightly, ready to drink now.",Companhia das Quintas 2009 Quinta do Cardo White (Beira Interior)
"Soft and easy-drinking, this plum and cherry Merlot drinks like an older wine, as if it's been gently oxidized. It's probably at its peak, the fruit generous and round, the finish tailing off gently into a Milky Way sort of confection.",Eliseo Silva 2007 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a brisk, clean wine, marked by tart acidity that scours the palate and prepares it for food. The followup flavors are of spicy tropical citrus fruits and green, savory gooseberries. The grapes are from a coolish vineyard near Santa Rosa.",Enkidu 2008 Kick Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Very berry, with sour candy scents and cooked red fruit flavors floating over a base of seasoned leather. Juicy, medium finish. Drink up.",Flinders Run 2008 Little Flinders Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Southern Flinders Ranges)
"Quite an impressive wine, especially at this price. A blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Sémillon without much oak, it's an interestingly complex white, with good weight and density and intricate flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and lemongrass. Finishes totally dry, although the acidity is a little clumsy.",Frostwatch 2009 Kismet White (Bennett Valley)
"The best of Glen Fiona's current releases, this displays cool-climate varietal character, with mountain berry fruit, herb, spice, tar and a streak of licorice.",Glen Fiona 2006 Basket Press Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Not offering much now beyond a full body, big tannins, lots of oak and extracted blackberry jam and milk chocolate fruit. There's lots of deliciousness, but not much elegance or sophistication. Roll the dice and stash it for six years to see what happens.",Guarachi Family 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Sourced largely from Red Mountain fruit, this includes 18% Merlot in the blend. It's toasty and ripe, with the barrel flavors most evident in both nose and palate. The Cabernet fruit is mild and lightly peppery, berry and cranberry mostly. There is plenty of chocolate, toast, coffee and smoke as well, presumably from aging 20 months in oak.",Hightower 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"For a value-priced wine this scores well. The nose offers a nice mix of earth, warmth and berry fruit, while the palate is juicy, fresh and tastes of zesty berry. Composed on the finish, which is also fresh and lively. Perfect for by-the-glass or casual consumption.",Maximo 2007 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Great price for a super-drinkable Sauvignon Blanc. Brilliantly crisp and mouthwateringly clean, it delivers bone-dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits, with a wildflowery spiciness.",Mirassou 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"A big, soft, juicy Petite Sirah filled with rich flavors of melted milk chocolate, blackberry jam, blueberries and peppery spices. Feels voluptuous in the mouth, almost like a liquid dessert, but it's nice and dry on the finish. Good value.",Villa San Juliette 2007 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"A mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.",Viña Albali 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"Light and easy, and made for drinking now. Shows plenty of charm, with dry, crisp flavors of herbs, red currants, tobacco and spices, wrapped into scoury tannins.",Wild Horse 2008 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)

"Very soft, ripe grapefruit and kumquat flavors, lifted by acidity. The wine is broad, full in the mouth, crispness well integrated. Great final fruit.",Fournier Père et Fils 2008 La Charnivolle  (Menetou-Salon)
"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, young and fruity, with tart berry and bitter herb. The light but slightly green tannins add some useful counterpoint to the cherry pop fruit, giving the wine a more substantial palate impression and length in the finish.",Magnificent Wine Company 2008 Steak House Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A young wine, dark purple in color, whose aromas are dominated now by oak. The sweet, sappy vanilla scents mask the grapes, but not in the mouth, where jammy berry fruit is powerfully ripe. Fortunately, the wine is dry, with lively acids. —S.H.",Grant Burge 1999 Miamba Shiraz (Barossa Valley)
"This budget wine has sweet fruit and soft tannins, along with surprising concentration and length. Offsetting a hint of stemminess are generous, varietally true flavors, and a rich, meaty nose that suggests beef and coffee. Best Buy. —P.G.",Columbia Crest 1999 Grand Estates Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This lighter-styled, mature Rioja shows just a hint of brown at the edges. An initial light sweaty note blows off quickly, revealing appealing dried cherry, spice and wood aromas and flavors, and an elegant, balanced mouthfeel. Tannins are mostly resolved, drink now–2005. —M.M.",Coto de Imaz 1994 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)
"Nice black cherry fruit powers the nose, with just the barest hints of stem and root. Firm fruit is buttressed by tart acids, and the middle opens up sweetly, adding flavors of cocoa and coffee. —P.G.",Pontin del Roza 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)
"This pretty wine shows how well this variety thrives in Lodi. There's a mushu pork note, with peppery plum aromas and flavors that are delicious, and yet the wine is bone dry. Adequate acids and tannins make for balance. It may not be a complex wine but it's a thoroughly enjoyable one. Best Buy.",Peirano 1998 Shiraz (Lodi)
"The winery's penchant for delicate, lightly balanced wines is again evident here. This has some pleasant herb flavors, gentle nuances of grass and citrus. Cleanly made and finished with a touch of spice. —P.G.",Ste. Chapelle 2000 Fumé Blanc (Idaho)
"Smells like Pinot, combining leather, smoke and tart cherry aromas. In the mouth, this light-to-medium-weight wine doesn't show a lot of fruity flavors, but rather leather, dried spices and dusty notes. Juicy cherries gradually emerge on the finish.",Stefano Lubiana 1999 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)
"This full-bodied effort goes down surprisingly easy. Aromas of shoe polish, black plums and a dash of black pepper presage flavors of blackberry, plum and brandied spice cake. Finishes with warm notes of chocolate and spice. —J.C.",Kangarilla Road 2000 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"This is the first vintage of this wine that will be available in the United States and it makes a positive first impression. It's a delicious blend of spice, floral notes and strawberries that finishes with soft, caressing tannins.",Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2000 Campo ai Sasso  (Rosso di Montalcino)
"It seems as if the emphasis is more on the oak than on the fruit. But the oak is darn tasty—toasty, vanillin and bringing all sorts of dried-spice complexities to the table. The wine is creamy and full enough to support the oak, even if the cherry-berry flavors do take a back seat. —J.C.",Hollick 1998 Wilgha Shiraz (Coonawarra)
"At 93% Shiraz, many wineries would have just labeled it as Shiraz, but not Hollick. The wine itself has lots of tart, almost sour, cherry fruit that marries well with the earthy, bitter undercurrents. Very smooth and supple in the mouth. Only light tannins make this a wine to drink now. —J.C.",Hollick 1999 Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (Limestone Coast)
"This structured, medium-weight wine's nose offers dried apple and nutty aromas. Crisp lime and stony notes come up strongly on the palate. The mouth shows good tension and decent acidity, the flavors are persistent on the solid finish of this tasty white. Drink now–2004. Best Buy. —M.M.",Huguet de Can Feixes 2000 Can Feixes Blanc Selecciò White (Catalonia)
"Add this new winery to the growing list of Walla Walla-based boutiques. The Syrah is plump and juicy, a round, fruity red wine that is perfectly enjoyable. —P.G.",Sariah Cellars 2000 Syrah (Red Mountain)
". Nice drinking wine, dry and silky, with generous berry and herb flavors and a tasteful touch of fine oak. That said, it's fuller-bodied than you'd expect, given the league it plays in. Seems to lack the delicacy and transparency that cool-weather Pinot typically achieves. —S.H.",Rutz 1999 Martinelli Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Mayo knows how to make sweetish Zins that should be dry. Here's their effort at an outrightly sweet Zin, and it ain't bad. Curranty, raisiny aromas lead to cassis and blackberry jam flavors that are immensely ripe, and the sugar level is dessert-high. It's warmly satisfying. Try with, or over, vanilla ice cream, and be happy. —S.H.",Mayo 2000 Ricci Vineyard Unfiltered Zinfandel Port Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This medium-to full-bodied red from Spain's southeast sports a potent, inviting nose. Black plum, soy, leather and oak merge in an appealing, inky opening. The black cherry flavors are quite dry, but also rich and palate-coating. Finishes with substantial tannins. The wine should drink even better in one or two years, but should pair well with hearty fare even now. Best Buy. —M.M.",Mayoral 2000 Cosecha Red (Jumilla)
"This kitchen-sink blend boasts a high percentage of Petit Verdot (38%), which may account for its dramatic floral aromatics. Aside from roses, cherries also play a role. In the mouth, complex floral-herbal elements have a solid underpinning of cherries and raspberries, finishing with just enough tannins to stand up to rare beef. —J.C.",Craneford 2000 Quartet Red (Barossa Valley)
"The oak jumps out a bit, with plenty of vanilla and a bit of dill, too. A medium-bodied Merlot, still young and tannic and not yet unwrapped. Additional cellar time will help. —P.G.",Columbia Winery 1999 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is one of Columbia's strengths, turning out perfectly crafted white wines at budget prices. The Gewürz is off-dry, rich and roundly fruity, loaded with mouthfilling, lipsmacking flavors. Chill it to cut the sweetness and you have the perfect wine for spicy noodle dishes.",Columbia Winery 2001 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A popular style, fruity and forward, with the emphasis on citrus, grapefruit and apricot, rather than floral qualities. Sweet fruit set against tangy acid makes it a versatile food wine too.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2001 Gewürztraminer (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This Bordeaux variety more often than not produces a light, fruity wine of charm and early drinkability. Here, the sour cherry fruit is framed in dry, dusty tannins and soft acids. There's an elegance and spicy aftertaste that are very nice. —S.H.",Yorkville Cellars 1997 Cabernet Franc (Yorkville Highlands)
"The style is rich and ripe fruit, with the fruit pushing through into tropical. Nice handling of the oak adds just enough butter and light spice. A hint of bitterness mars the finish.",Arbor Crest 2000 Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There is just a hint of volatile acidity, enough to brighten the nose, which has Bing cherry and chocolate as well. In the mouth, the fruit has some herb and dill to it, an indication of a cooler vintage, and some fairly stiff tannins. —P.G.",Gordon Brothers 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A wonderfully fragrant nose mixes scents of fresh fruits and  blossoms, with a sweet and tart flavor profile. These are very user friendly flavors, ripe and round, with more fatness than most Washington Rieslings, especially at this price. Best Buy.",Columbia Crest 2001 Johannisberg Riesling (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This lively white shows a spritz on the tongue. It's crisp without being sharp, and the citrus notes here tend to orange and they complement tasty stone fruit and floral elements. Finishes clean and light, a great choice for any seafood, any warm evening. —M.M.",Condes de Albarei 2000 Albariño (Rías Baixas)
"Oversized, with massive berry-cherry flavors that explode in the mouth. In fact, it's too big. The spicy fruity flavors are so powerful they dominate every other feature. That said, it's dry, and the tannins are soft and intricate. Match it with dramatic, boldly flavored dishes. —S.H.",Gallo of Sonoma 1997 Frei Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"Kicks off with pretty cherry notes in the nose. Dry and bright on the palate, the wine shows lovely ripe Bing cherry flavors, elegant citrus and clean mineral notes. A refreshing and satisfying rosé.",Gargiulo 2000 Rosato di Sangiovese Sangiovese (Oakville)
"A soft, round wine that almost seems designed for glugging. Dusty earth and dried grass aromas give way to a sweet, alcoholic attack filled with red berries and cherries. The warm, spirity finish leaves you glowing and reaching for another sip. —J.C.",Oliverhill 2000 Bradey Block Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"Black cherry, clove and smoked meat aromas are rolled up into one wondrously savory scent in this 50-50 blend of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Flavors of beef roasted in blackberry and Sherry sauce sprinkled with oregano and marjoram entertain the complex palate.",II Moons 2011 Ardor Red (Paso Robles)
"Right away this pitch-dark Malbec displays max ripeness through a dynamic mix of prune, blackberry, coconut, violet petal and leathery aromas. A hugely concentrated palate is hardly a shock, while firm acidity cuts a viscous palate with ripe cassis, plum, blackberry and black cherry flavors. Drink this voluptuous wine through 2022.",Alta Vista 2012 Single Vineyard Alizarine Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Pure blackberry, cassis and charcoal aromas come with a sweet oak-based scent of maple. This is a beast of a wine with lushness and padding to the palate along with huge tannins and fine oak framework. Toasty, chocolaty oak flavors caress a black-fruit explosion prior to a saturated finish that spreads out like a slow-moving lava flow. Drink through 2022.",Alta Vista 2012 Single Vineyard Serenade Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Coming from a vineyard west of Paso Robles that peeks at the ocean surrounding Morro Rock, this is a dense expression of the grape, with dried strawberries, blackberries, smoked pork butt, star anise and lots of smoke on the nose. The palate is rich and lively, with decent mineral-driven restraint, showing a mouth-watering flavor array of dense blackberries and spicy Sichuan peppercorns.",Asuncion Ridge 2012 Barrel Select Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)
"Made by Kirk Venge from a Dutton Ranch vineyard site, this wine immediately offers a lot to like, from its earthy sassafras and compelling layers of crisp raspberry and cherry, to its soft layers of oaky density accented in rose. Requiring more time to open, with an ideal cellaring through 2023, it finishes with a flair of cedar and vanilla, lasting long on the palate.",B Cellars 2013 Manzana Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Billecart-Salmon's style is dry, so an Extra Brut will be almost bone-dry. This wine is crisp and tight, bringing out grapefruit and citrus flavors and a steely, mineral character. It is still young, with freshness dominant, and needs to mature to blossom into a very fine Champagne. Drink from 2018.",Billecart-Salmon 2006 Vintage Extra Brut  (Champagne)
"A beautifully balanced wine that abounds in elegance and restrained richness, this wine offers enticing floral, almond and citrus aromas. The crisp, creamy palate brings nectarine zest, yellow apple, mineral notes and bread crust. Tight acidity and an intense, elegant perlage provide the framework. Drink now or hold for complexity.",Ca' del Bosco 2010 Vintage Collection Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"A proprietary blend of 57% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, all homegrown, this is dense and powerful, rich in red fruit but also savory in tobacco, black tea and leather. Reflective of the appellation's ability to combine power with elegance, it fully represents and should continue to meld beautifully together in the cellar. Drink now through 2022.",Chimney Rock 2012 Elevage Estate Grown Red (Stags Leap District)
"This top wine from Joseph Perrier is rich, full in the mouth and well balanced. It is at the midway point of Brut, neither too sweet nor dry, giving ripe, creamy apple flavors and refreshing, concentrated acidity. There is no sign yet of maturity, the wine still so fresh. Drink now for the liveliness or wait until 2018 for maturity.",Joseph Perrier 2004 Cuvée Josephine Brut  (Champagne)
"From a great Champagne vintage, this rich, full-bodied wine is just beginning to develop secondary flavors, toast and walnuts. The red fruits are fading into the background, while keeping the acidity in place. It is ripe, well balanced and has a delicious, long aftertaste. It is ready to drink.",Ruinart 2002 Dom Ruinart Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"This reserve-level wine is down to just three barrels in this vintage. It's creamy and yet precisely defined, with generous layers of pineapple, lime, golden apple and lemon tea. A bracing minerality underscores gently oaked, finishing notes of melba toast and almond butter.",Domaine Drouhin Oregon 2013 Édition Limitée Chardonnay (Dundee Hills)
"Linear and intense, this elegant blend of 70% Pinot Nero and 30% Chardonnay opens with aromas of fragrant flowers, yeast and a whiff of orchard fruit. The firm, focused palate delivers ripe apple, citrus zest, almond and energizing mineral notes alongside an ultrafine, persistent perlage that carries through to the quenching, bone dry finish. It's overflowing with finesse.",Maso Martis 2010 Dosaggiozero Riserva Sparkling (Trento)
"Seared yellow grapefruit, white flowers and a hint of almonds make for a fresh but simultaneously nutty nose on this classic bottling from the historic producer, whose grapes come from the top of the high-elevation appellation. The extremely energized palate is enlivened by flavors of salted lemons, a buttery warmth and racy yet rich minerality, from chalk and slate to graphite and flint.",Mount Eden Vineyards 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Planted in 1999 specifically for the producer, this vineyard block provides power and structure, revealing shocks of blackberry jam, mocha and gunpowder amidst a streak of wild anise and black pepper. Robust and bold, it begs for another 10 to 15 years in the cellar before finding its complete composure.",Robert Biale 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard The Biale Block Zinfandel (Napa Valley)
"Subtle notes of candied apricot mingle with barley sugar and light caramel in this splendid Eiswein. The palate reveals more intrigue, with pure lemon zest and aromatic inflections of crushed citrus foliage. While there is ample sweetness, this is cut by razor-sharp freshness and held in perfect poise. With time, ever more flavors join in: baked apple, candied orange peel and passion fruit. In its character, this would suit desserts that major on tropical, exotic fruit.",Rosenhof 2012 Orion Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"The lively mousse carries this sophisticated wine, which is the perfect partner to the Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs. Everything is in its place, well integrated and with great precision. This trends to the sweeter side of Brut but with bottle age this has brought fine secondary flavors that are ripe and rich. The wine will age further, drink until 2020.",Taittinger 2006 Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé  (Champagne)
"Toasty woodsmoke aromas are matched by wild berry, cassis, cherry and marshmallow scents on the nose of this huge Malbec. Creamy feeling but also inky and fully concentrated, this tastes like black cherry and cough drops. Candied ripeness carries onto the finish along with chocolate and dry spice flavors. Drink through 2022.",Viña Cobos 2012 Bramare Marchiori Vineyard Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"Blackened and charred on the nose, there are also blueberry, herb and earth notes to get this balanced yet huge Malbec going. Blackberry, black plum and pie crust flavors finish cedary, with pastry notes and lasting black fruit. If you want power but also elegance and purity from your red wine, this is it. Drink through 2022.",Viña Cobos 2012 Bramare Touza Vineyard Malbec (Luján de Cuyo)
"From a three-acre vineyard, this wine accented in 2% Petit Verdot offers a sense of gravel underneath the dark, syrupy plum and leathery tannin structure. Midway through, it exhibits cherry, raspberry and vanilla, showing a juicy underbelly that should develop further over time. Drink now through 2022.",Von Strasser 2012 Agira Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"This world-class blend of 52% Cabernet Franc, 20% Malbec, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot is concentrated, structured and powerful, with the promise of a long life ahead. Earthy, herbal streaks of cigar box, licorice root, char and minty fynbos frame the lush fruit core of muddled boysenberry, black raspberry, plum and currant. The palate is bold and assertively flavored, with good evolution from jammy black fruit to earthy spice and finally leather and toast on the finish. Drink 2018–2024.",Mvemve Raats 2011 MR de Compostella Red (Stellenbosch)
"From the producer's oldest hillside vineyard, planted in 1967, comes this gem of a wine, a taste of cinnamon toast and black currant. Layered acidity forms a backbone against which concentrated flavors of graham cracker and dark chocolate lie, the finish long and deep. It's built to age, enjoy now through 2025.",Von Strasser 2012 Spaulding Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"A blend of 28% Cabernet Franc, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot and 10% Merlot, this is a big, bold and powerful wine, with superb balance and a firm, concentrated structure that promises great long-term aging. Dense aromas and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, cherry and fig are layered with notes of cocoa powder, roasted espresso bean and cigar tobacco. Ripe, rich and lush, but not overdone, hints of charred oak and black pepper linger on the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",Mvemve Raats 2012 MR de Compostella Red (Stellenbosch)
"Voluptuously tropical in shaved coconut and silky layers of peach and pear, this is a complex, age-worthy white from a stellar vineyard site, a knockout version of the variety. Smooth and round, it maintains a core of acidity that buoys the experience, finishing with a flourish. Drink now through 2022.",Paul Hobbs 2012 Ulises Valdez Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Exotic fruit aromas and concentrated fruit flavors make this full-bodied wine an attention grabber at first sip. They hold the attention through a fine-grained mouthfeel and lingering finish. A focused core of black-currant flavor runs from first whiff to last impression. It needs time, so drink after 2017.",Spell 2012 Alder Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"Creamy brie rind aromas mesh with scratched yellow grapefruit skin and a steely minerality on the nose of this small-batch bottling from a winery atop the appellation's ridgeline. Light and focused flavors of kumquat juice, iodine and lime skin satisfy the palate, and would be a perfect match for shellfish.",Thomas Fogarty 2012 Albutom Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Crisply fresh, this full-bodied wine has citrus fruitiness that is followed by hints of toast and honey that are just developing. Well balanced, it's very textured while also fruity, and will develop well in bottle. Drink from 2017 for the more mature flavors to bring their own character to the wine.",Pol Roger 2008 Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"One of the appellation's more famous wines, this opens in black licorice and blackberry, alongside a streak of malted chocolate, soft and sinewy, with a tension of acidity that adds age-worthy structure. Dense and interesting now, it'll get better over time, cellaring well through 2027.",Beaulieu Vineyard 2012 Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Delivering elegance and structure, this stunning wine opens with delicate aromas of bread crust, toast, dried fruit, pastry cream and nectarine zest that all carry over to the silky palate.

"This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose. The palate is complex and fascinating, with chalk and cement minerality bolstered by lime blossom, kumquat and tonic that opens graciously with time.

"It show the vintage's weakness, with a vegetal edge to the cherries and oak.",Gary Farrell 2011 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Strong wood-aging flavors give a spice and bitter chocolate character. The result, though, is that the wood softens the potentially stalky fruit and helps accent the underlying red berry flavors with attractive acidity. Drink now.",Petite Sirène 2012  Bordeaux

"This basic SB blends aromas of coastal snap with tropical sweetness. In the mouth, it shows basic flavors of grapefruit and spiced citrus. On the finish, peppery bitterness comes up.",Viña Casablanca 2013 Cefiro Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"Because of way too much oak, all you get are tastes of buttered toast, butterscotch and vanilla honey. Somewhere underneath is a perfectly good wine, with fine acidity and mango, pineapple and lime flavors.",Laird 2010 Cold Creek Chardonnay (Carneros)
"Soft and gently fruity, it's fairly basic but does provide a Pinot Noir character. The wine has red cherries, light acidity and a jammy aftertaste. Drink now.",Louis Chavy 2012  Bourgogne
"High alcohol, with its burn and glyceriney sweetness, mars this otherwise good Syrah. The tannins are polished and smooth, the acidity brisk and clean, but the wine's raisiny, port-like finish detracts.",Santa Barbara Winery 2011 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills)
"The Fusion in question is the blend—an unusual combination of 61% Pinot Noir, 21% Syrah and 18% Merlot. Some tasters will find it works well as an everyday, all-purpose red. The jumble of red fruits is matched to a strong streak of vanilla, with some stemmy flavors coming up in the tannins.",Sweet Cheeks 2012 Pinot Fusion Red (Oregon)
"This one-dimensional wine has muted aromas that recall tropical fruit. The palate doesn't give much away either, revealing subtle citrus and pear notes alongside racy acidity.",Tinazzi 2013 Ca' de' Rocchi  (Lugana)
"Not much going on beyond lots of oak and crisp, Central Coast acidity. You'll find watered down orange and tropical fruits.",Cru 2012 Vineyard Montage Chardonnay (Monterey County)

"Soft, ripe and fruity, this is a smooth and clean wine. It has yellow fruit, pineapple and white currant flavors that give a perfumed edge. It's not a wine for aging, so drink now.",Herdade do Rocim 2012 Bojador Branco White (Alentejano)
"Muddled aromas of yellow flower and beeswax come along with sensations that recall Band-Aids and antiseptic. The bitter medicinal notes carry over to the palate along with minerality and a hint of rock candy, and the wine lacks fruit richness.",Vigneti Villabella 2012 Ca' del Lago  (Lugana)
"The wine has some of the typical freshness of 2011 but it seems on the thin side. Black currant flavors run alongside high acidity, and the tannins show strongly. The aftertaste brings out more tight, mineral acidity.",Château la Petite Roque 2010  Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux
Offers a glimpse of a fully mature wine from Bergerac. It has retained strong and dense tannins that are showing signs of drying the wine. The tough core is not likely to go away. Drink now.,Château le Castellot 2006 L'Excellence  (Montravel)

"Blended from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, this sparkler is a little rough in texture, with candied orange, lemon and lime flavors. But it has good bubbles and a clean, elegant finish.",Collection 35 2012 Brut Sparkling (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Tannins mark this big, dry Syrah. It shows Spring Mountain's intensity of fruit, in this case blackberries, but that tannic bitterness dominates, making the wine difficult to appreciate. It's hard to imagine it aging.",Due Cani 2009 Bella's Collection Syrah (Spring Mountain District)
"A soft, perfumed wine, it shows attractive light black currant flavors as well as some tannins, acidity and a young fruity character. It is ready to drink now.",Fleury 2012 Ilixens  (Bordeaux)

It tastes like a cool-climate example because of the vivid fruit, layered tannins and good acidity, which make it well balanced in the style of classic dry reds.",The Federalist 2013 Zinfandel (Lodi)
"A majority varietal, a dying breed in the Napa Valley, this also has 5% Petite Sirah. The combination is dense and syrupy in strawberry and a tightness of oak. Time will soften its edges, and there's already a softness to the tannins that delights, the finish light and lean. Cellar through 2017.",Tofanelli Family 2012 Estate Charbono (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of toast, wild berry and cake spice come together in the glass. The firm, structured palate delivers dried red cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and grilled herb.

"Made with 65% Nebbiolo, 20% Vespolina and 15% Uva Rara, this polished red from Piedmont offers aromas and flavors of dried red cherry, clove, baking spice and rust. It's well balanced, with silky tannins and fresh acidity while a graphite note closes the finish.",Vallana 2009  Boca

"Representative of the solid values that may be found from Australia for about $20, this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz offers a blend of cherry and plum flavors, with savory elements of mocha and roasted meat.

This blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% Mourvèdre features intriguing notes of cola, brown sugar and cinnamon layered over a plush base of ripe black cherries. It's mouthfilling and round, with a soft, licorice-tinged finish. Drink now–2018.",Angove 2013 Family Crest G-S-M (McLaren Vale)
"This delicate wine, a medley of rose petals, cherries and a streak of cola, is labeled simply Oregon due to TTB regulations, but in fact is a single-vineyard effort from the Yamhill-Carlton AVA. It's pale and pretty, and seems to be on a fast track for aging. Drink now through 2017 and you're in for an elegant and complex Pinot.",Animale 2012 Pinot Noir (Oregon)

"Faint aromatics hide an effusiveness on the palate of thick, dense blackberry jam and brown sugar, the ripe power of the wine kept in check by a balance of acidity. Fuller bodied in style, it remains dry and vibrant on the finish.",August Briggs 2012 Old Vines Zinfandel (Calistoga)
"Made from a selection of premium parcels, this wood-aged wine still shows evidence of its toast and firm extract. So although there is plenty of fruit there, it's the dry core that is evident. It could still soften, so wait until 2017 to drink.",Azamor 2010 Selected Vines Red (Alentejano)

"Made in a delicious, dry style, this has a vivid yellow-gold color, lemon and butter aromas, a touch of honey in the Bosc pear flavors and a creamy texture that leads to a long finish. Not much of this variety is made in California and the acreage is dwindling in Livermore Valley, so this bottling is a rare treat.",Fenestra 2013 Semillon (Livermore Valley)
"Yellow skinned and Asian pears, jasmine flowers, lemon slices and a slight petrol note entertain the nose on this single-vineyard bottling from a part of the Parker family's estate that was planted in 1989. The palate is quite balanced between flavors of lemon-lime soda, tangerine juice and limestone minerality.",Fess Parker 2013 Rodney's Vineyard Riesling (Santa Barbara County)

"What a surprise to find such a delicate and berry-driven Pinot Nero from sunny Umbria in central Italy. This tastes very much like a Pinot you'd find in any northern region with feminine fruit and floral nuances lavished over by raspberry, vanilla, honey, cola and lavender. It's fragrant and buoyant in the mouth with loads of personality and bright acidity on the close: a pleasure to drink.",Barberani 2006 Pinot Nero (Lago di Corbara)

"Fans of superfruity, oaky, big Chards will love this one.

There's also a lot of new, smoky oak.",Adelaida 2005 HMR Estate Santa Lucia Highland Range Chardonnay (Paso Robles)
"This is Bacchus vineyard fruit, as per normal – these vines are something like 35 years old. It's all stainless-steel fermented, aged on the lees and finished at 13% alcohol. Fruit flavors of peach and pineapple fill the mouth with round, lightly spicy flavors. It's ripe but not sweet, tart but not too citrusy. Good balance and texture through the finish.",Arbor Crest 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is a pretty, pale purple/rose; bright, peppery and rather delicate. It shows excellent floral aspects, like a good Beaujolais - it's somewhere between Pinot Noir and Gamay, with big fat grapes and heavy clusters that somehow produce a real finesse wine. The acids keep it lively, the peppery notes add a lot of spice and the floral qualities turn the tart cranberry fruit into something special.",Syncline 2006 Cinsault (Horse Heaven Hills)
"The grapes sure got ripe even in this cool, balanced vintage, so that the wine is jammy in cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors. It's delicious and crisply elegant, with a silky texture, but a little direct and forward. Probably at its best now.",Tandem 2005 Sangiacomo Vineyards Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

"This is a vibrant and lively wine with a sweet portfolio of aromas including red fruit, spice, rose bud, milk chocolate and almond nut.

Its fruity flavors are slightly sweet and the wine ends on a bright, cheerful note.",Fattoria Fibbiano 2004 L'Aspetto Red (Toscana)
"Minty and dusty at first, with secondary floral aromas that make you take notice.

Only 250 cases produced.",La Playa 2005 Axel Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This dessert wine is such a deep amber color, it is reminiscent of a gleaming copper pot.

It's thick and syrupy in the mouth with loads of honey-roasted nut flavors.",Le Caniette 2000 Sibilla Appeninica Vin Santo Passerina (Marche)
"For all of this wine's 14.5% alcohol, it's not that rich, instead presenting a medium-bodied, elegant palate feel. Hints of violets and cracked pepper are attractive on the nose, easily marrying with the wine's flavors of black olive, meat, sour plum and slightly pruny notes. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",Te Awa 2004 Zone 2 Syrah (Hawke's Bay)

"This blend of 46% Cabernet Sauvignon, 37% Syrah and 17% Petit Verdot retains a reductive quality on the nose even after being opened for quite a while, with slightly funky blackberry and burnt cedar aromas. Dried blackberries and black cherries show on the palate, but the tarry sensation permeates throughout.",The Farm Winery 2011 The Big Game Red (Paso Robles)
"Pink grapefruit and lemon rind notes are elevated on the nose, with wet stone and candied watermelon lingering in the background. The palate on this 100% Merlot rosé is citrus-driven, yet an impression of roundness comes from tart peach and melon tones.",Trump 2014 Rosé (Monticello)
"Actor Sam Neill's Central Otago wine estate is sometimes billed as the southernmost in the world. The 2011 is a tart, medium-bodied wine blanketed in caramel- and mocha-scented oak.

"The nose on this wine is very peachy, boosted in the ripe department by banana, honeysuckle and tuberose. The palate is also rich and forward, with dried apricots and buttered peaches.

The texture is smooth, rather lush and the wine is light to medium bodied.",Coyote Creek 2013 Chardonnay (California)

"At first, this wine tastes overworked, with very ripe pineapple, lime and mango flavors elaborated with sweet new oak.

If it finished drier, the score would soar.",Signorello 2009 SETA Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)

"Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet. A bit sticky and it falls off on the finish, but overall it's a nice value red.",Valentin Bianchi 2010 Elsa Bianchi Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Good, rich and spicy Zin from Williams Selyem winemaker Bob Cabral. It's not the most memorable Bacigalupi ever, with a somewhat soft, simple structure.

"With lemon, orange, apricot and green melon flavors, this is a fruity wine, with tart notes of green gooseberries that make it savory. There's a lot of honey on the finish that makes you wonder if it's truly dry or flirting with off-dry.",Balverne 2012 Forever Wild Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Made from 100% Cab Franc, this is a soft, rather one-dimensional wine. It has complex flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, white pepper and herbs, but is short on structure and interest. Drink now.",Boëté 2009 Saunders Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Franc (Carmel Valley)

"This is a sharp-edged wine with green-tinged fruits—apples and pears not quite ripe. It pushes accents of herb and stem forward, and will probably drink best with food rather than on its own.",J. Scott Cellars 2016 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas are light, with notes of matchstick, herb and cherry. The cherry and plum flavors are sweet and generous, providing easy-drinking appeal.",14 Hands 2014 Limited Release Kentucky Derby Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Opens with a sublime bouquet of tobacco, perfume and baked cherry that conveys a sense of elegance. The palate is saturated and full, with integrated tannins and flavors of molasses, licorice and prime black fruits. This is probably a denser, slightly more ripe version of “M” than in past years, evidenced by the licorice, sweetness and coffee on the chewy finish. Drink now and over the next couple of years.",Montes 2006 Alpha M Red (Santa Cruz)
"You can feel the richness of this wine as it rolls opulently around the mouth. The Grüner spice character is dominant, giving intense concentration to go with the yellow fruits. Acidity is a balanced addition to the mix on this impressive wine.",Alzinger 2007 Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Pretty deep and sweet-smelling, with aromas of marzipan and dense fruit that hint at raisin but don't fully go there. The mouthfeel is sensuous and smooth, yet lively enough to push the cassis, raspberry and plum flavors in the right direction. Tobacco, herb and dry fruit flavors work the finish, and overall this is one balanced, pleasing wine. Drink now through 2011.",Errazuriz 2006 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserva Red (Aconcagua Valley)
"The price on this high-end Chilean Shiraz keeps climbing, but on the plus side so does the quality. This is the best La Cumbre Errazuriz has made; it's sweet on the nose, with marzipan, earth, sautéed mushroom and big black-fruit aromas. The palate is round and rewarding, with huge blackberry and raspberry flavors. Deep, leathery, meaty and impressive. Drink now through 2011.",Errazuriz 2006 La Cumbre Shiraz (Aconcagua Valley)
"Mont-Pérat is on slopes overlooking the Garonne river, offering great exposure. Maybe that's why this wine is so well balanced, its ripe fruits sliced open with acidity. The texture is smooth, given spice from judicious wood aging. This is a wine to drink this year.",Château Mont-Pérat 2006  Bordeaux Blanc
"A delicious, mature Champagne, probably Jacquart's best release. The initial youthful softness has been transformed into a rich, toasty, aromatic wine, with a ripe, but crisp finish. It is now in perfect condition.",Jacquart NV Katarina Brut  (Champagne)
"Monterey's cool-climate flavors of lemons and limes marry richer, more tropical Santa Barbara notes in this creamy smooth Chardonnay. Oak plays a prominent role, lending an edge of vanilla and buttered toast. This is a very good price for the quality.",Kendall-Jackson 2007 Grand Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Barbara-Monterey)
"Achieves the difficult feat of tasting sweet but finishing dry. The pineapple custard, peach pie and butterscotch flavors are impossible to resist, yet the wine firms up on the finish, with a scour of dry acidity.",Maple Creek 2007 Estate Chardonnay (Yorkville Highlands)
"Stash this in the cellar for a while, because even though it's well over three years old, it's still a big, immature wine. Dry and tannic, it explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries, chocolate, cola, licorice, orange zest and pepper flavors, wrapped into sweet, smoky oak. The parts should begin to come together by the end of 2009.",Sunstone 2005 Estate Bottled Reserve Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)
"A new product from Rotari, this Riserva sparkling wine (from 90% Chardonnay and 10% Pinot Nero) demonstrates great intensity and round, toasty flavors of fresh baguette, baked apple, honey and fruit. The wine rests on the lees for 48 months for extra creaminess.",Rotari 2003 Talento Riserva Sparkling (Trento)
"Although this tastes younger than some recent bottlings of this great nonvintage, it is still a fine wine. Its apple flavors meld effortlessly with citrus, grapefruit zest and just a touch of toast to show the depth of flavor that will emerge after a few more months in bottle.",Louis Roederer NV Premier Brut  (Champagne)
"Here's a big, bold Pinot Noir that's almost like a Grenache in its full-bodied juiciness. It's very bright and ripe in black and red cherry, raspberry, milk chocolate and toffee flavors, with interesting spicy nuances of anise, cinnamon and pepper. Now through 2011.",Cinnabar 2007 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"One of Brancott's best Sauvignons in recent memory, the 2008 B is intensely herbal on the nose, featuring green tomatoes and bell pepper, but only mildly vegetal on the palate--well within the bounds of acceptable varietal character. It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with a long, mouth-tingling finish. Try with sole Basquaise.",Brancott 2008 B Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Owned by France's national agricultural research institute, this estate has been curiously underperforming until the last two vintages. This 2007, almost entirely Sauvignon Blanc, continues the improvement, a deliciously fresh, herbaceous wine, with a currant freshness on top of grapefruit and lime.",Château Couhins 2007  Pessac-Léognan
"Thieuley's vineyard is on a ridge in the heart of Entre-deux-Mers. This top white cuvée, with its light wood aging, shows the wonderful freshness of the vintage while also giving some rich, full white fruits, spice and a smooth, creamy texture.",Château Thieuley 2007 Cuvée Francis Courselle  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"Does a great job at providing identity to this variety that can often seem a bit muddled. With the structure of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, it's softer, with more of a red fruit and red currant taste. Feels elegant and distinguished from beginning to end. Drink now.",Viansa 2006 Merlot (Sonoma County)
"A very good wine that easily earns its score, but is not perfect. It's a bit on the fruity-sweet, one-dimensional side, with jammy pineapple and apricot flavors, enriched with sweet, smoky, vanilla-accented oak. Yet fine, firm coastal acidity provides needed balance.",Heintz 2007 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Full-bodied, complex and delicious, with extraordinarily ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate, grilled meat, tamari, violets, sweet fresh herbs and black pepper. Quite dry and tannic now, with a youthful, primary fruit character that suggests ageability. Best 2010–2012.",Terre Rouge 2006 High Slopes Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Soft and perfumed, the flavors are elegant but intense at the same time. The acidity gives a great freshness to what is in fact a rich wine, the apple and pear flavors going deep down to the steely core. It would be worth aging this wine—maybe 3–5 years.",Alzinger 2007 Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"There's power in this concentrated wine. The texture is rich, velvet, touched by pepper, ripe acidity and pear skins. Along with its creamy, rounded character, the wine has the bite of tight spice and a dry, firm core.",Alzinger 2007 Steinertal Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau)
"Owned by the Cathiard family of Château Smith Haut-Lafitte since 1994, the vineyard of Cantelys neighbors both Smith Haut-Lafitte and the Lurton-owned Rochemorin. The wine is rich, smooth, the wood well integrated, allowing fine wafts of herbaceous citrus and currant flavors to come out of the glass. It's ready to drink now, but could age over 2–3 years.",Château Cantelys 2007  Pessac-Léognan
"Ripe, with a touch of honey as if the botrytis for the sweet wine landed on these grapes as well. This dry white has creamy wood, spice and apricot flavors, making a delicious ripe wine, even with a touch of sweetness to the finish.",Château d'Yquem 2006 Ygrec  (Bordeaux Blanc)
"In its youth, this is intensely grassy, the grapefruit and green pepper flavors adding to the general crispness of the wine. It will be an attractive wine, full of pep, with a fine edge of minerality, spice and vivid white fruits.",Château Ferrande 2008  Graves
"One of the best sparkling Vouvrays, this 2005 vintage has an extra richness from the year. It has the mineral, chalky edge of Chenin Blanc, but this is rounded out with pear, white peach and sweet almond flavors. Good to drink now, but also worth aging for 2–3 years.",Château Moncontour 2005 Cuvée Prédilection Brut  (Vouvray)
"Foxen's UU bottling is practically an insurance policy for great Chardonnay in any vintage. With 2012, the winery was granted a balanced, even harvest, with the resulting wine showing brisk acidity and subtle fruit and mineral flavors, touched with sweet oak. It defines a cool-climate style of Chardonnay in a most delicious way.",Foxen 2012 Bien Nacido Vineyard Block UU Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"This is a big, ripe and fruity wine. It is now maturing well into a rich, solid, complex wine. This second wine from the Mouchão estate in Alentejo is gorgeous, opulent and rich. The black fruit character is powerful, with delicious acidity and a darkly tannic character. It is still very young, so drink from 2017.",Mouchão 2009 Ponte das Canas Colheita Red (Alentejano)
"The alcohol on this Cabernet is fairly high, yet the wine tastes and feels dry, supple and balanced in the mouth, with tannins so smooth, they're drinkable now. The flavors offer an interesting mélange of blackberries, black currants, green olives, sage and cinnamon. This is certainly an ageable wine that will reward your patience through 2020 or so.",Swanson 2010 Alexis Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This Syrah's outstanding feature isn't the ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, cocoa and smoked meat flavors, although they are delicious. It's the balance. The tannins are lovely, the acidity is just right and the finish is spicy and complex. The wine frames the Syrah argument in California in a new way.",Terlato 2010 Block 9 Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is a new cuvée for Trisaetum, from a vineyard in the Red Hills of Dundee. It shows some old vine character in its brambly, Burgundian elegance. Light flavors of raspberry and cherry float above a bed of clay, yet there is enough muscle for the wine to extend gracefully through a lingering finish, with a lick of chocolate. Enjoy it over the next decade or more.",Trisaetum 2011 Wichmann Dundee Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"Yellow freesia and sweet peach abound in this deeply floral, fruity auslese. Feather light in texture, yet deeply concentrated in flavor, it's penetratingly sweet yet finishes with a flurry of crushed minerals and lime-pith astringency.",Joh. Jos. Prüm 2011 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese Riesling (Mosel)
"Smoke and crushed-stone notes lend dramatic minerality to this dry, full-bodied Riesling. The palate is juicy with grapefruit flavor, but elegantly balanced with dried savory herbs and fine, focused acidity that reverberates from start to finish.",Rheingraf 2011 Scharlachberg Bingen GG Erste Lage Trocken Riesling (Rheinhessen)
"While still young, this is a wine that's full of potential. It's weighty and rich on the palate with concentrated apple and lemon flavors, but balanced with intense acidity and a lingering touch of toast. It will need aging, so drink from 2016.",Pascal Bouchard 2011 Montmains Premier Cru Les Vieilles Vignes  (Chablis)
"This is a structured, firm wine that's intensely tannic, but full of potential. Still brash and youthful, it's full of concentrated black-cherry and berry flavors that are unabashedly forward. The texture is dry and dense, but with age the wine should integrate. Drink from 2016.",Patrick Javillier 2011  Aloxe-Corton
"Rounded and soft, this is a wine that is still developing. It exhibits ripe, powerful fruit flavors, but with a spicy edge. Hints of wood aging show through as the wine opens up, but it's still young, and will need time to bring out its complexity. Drink from 2016.",Patrick Javillier 2011 Les Clousots  (Meursault)
"This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot has an inviting fragrance of cedar wood, black currant and a whiff of toasted oak. The palate delivers a solid core of black cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a tobacco note along with firm but refined tannins and just enough fresh acidity. Drink 2015–2020.",Renieri 2010 Re di Renieri Red (Toscana)
"Give this wine 3–5 years in the cellar to let the parts come together. Right now, it's an unconnected mélange of sweet cherry pie, mocha, licorice, toasty oak and dusty tannins. By 2016 it should start to find its harmonious sweet spot.",Rutherford Hill 2010 Reserve Merlot (Napa Valley)
"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage.",Trisaetum 2012 Coast Range Estate Riesling
"Full-bodied and rich, this wine is ripe with peach, apple and pear flavors but wonderfully integrated with acidity. Edgy texture and toasty hints of wood aging give the wine depth and complexity. Like any Grand Cru, it needs to be aged so drink from 2017.",Damien et Romain Bouchard 2011 Vaudésir Grand Cru  (Chablis)
"Finally there's a great California rosé that rivals the south of France. Aussie winemaker Harry Waye has crafted this brilliant blush, proving again that Grenache makes California's best pink wine. It's dry and crisply acidic, with delicate flavors of rose petals, peaches and yellow apricots. A hint of soft, smoky cream is the result of brief aging in neutral French oak.",Demetria 2012 Estate Rosé (Santa Ynez Valley)
"DFJ Vinhos manages this 16th century property which has produced a now mature wine. It has great balance, the berry fruits moving to secondary flavors of spice, smokiness, sweet tannins and hints of toast. It's ready to drink, but will continue to develop through 2017.",DFJ Vinhos 2008 Quinta do Rocio Red (Lisboa)
"Dark peach in color, the aromatics on this sparkling blend of 50% Chardonnay, 42% Pinot Noir and 8% Pinot Meunier are muted, but open in time to reveal wild strawberry and green apple. With structured acidity, expect a bite on the finish. Any kind of fresh seafood, especially oysters or calamari, would pair well here.",Domaine Chandon NV étoile Rosé Sparkling (Sonoma-Napa)
"With mouthwatering acidity, a stony minerality, modest alcohol and complex peach, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, this Chardonnay shows a Burgundian approach despite its California origins. Bone dry, it has a precise, chiseled elegance.",Foxen 2012 Tinaquaic Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Made from organically grown grapes, this impressive sparkler is made with no sugar or liqueur added. It has an expressive fragrance of white flowers and stone fruit, while the palate offers apple, citrus and roasted almond notes along with hints of spice. It's a perfect apéritif but will also pair beauitfully with shellfish.",Barone Pizzini 2009 Nature Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"From the legendary 1996 vintage, this is a bottling that only received its dosage in 2012. It is very dry, intensely crisp and packed with acidity and minerality. Still young and fruity, it's an impressive wine that will certainly improve with age. Drink through 2022.",J. Dumangin Fils 1996 Vinothèque Premier Cru Brut  (Champagne)
"Jarvis's Tempranillo is always one of the best in California. It's wonderfully smooth and soft, with a fine grip that gives traction to the cherry, olive and cola flavors. Falls somewhere in texture between a light, silky Pinot Noir and a medium-weight Merlot, but with a distinctive style all its own.",Jarvis 2011 Estate Grown Cave Fermented Tempranillo (Napa Valley)
"A gorgeous wine, showing precision and control. There's perfect balance between the lush, sweet black currant, cola, leather and sandalwood flavors, fine tannins, brisk acidity and smoky oak, as well as an underlying minerality that lends structure and context. The blend is Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache. This is one of the best Z Threes ever. Drink now–2016.",Zaca Mesa 2010 Z Three Estate Grown and Bottled G-S-M (Santa Ynez Valley)
"This wine is the vinous equivalent of biting into a ripe, juicy mango that has been drizzled with honey. It's viscous and full in feel, loaded with tropical flavors that linger on the finish. Perhaps a bit one note but represents it well.",Stratus 2008 Icewine Riesling (Niagara Peninsula)
"Rich and ripe, this wine shows a great balance between fresh, fragrant fruit and toasty hints of maturity. There's a soft feel on the palate, but a tangy, vibrant texture adds complexity to this very fine wine. Drink now or cellar through 2018.",Thiénot 2002 Cuvée Alain Thienot Brut Millesimé  (Champagne)
"A fine effort in a cool year, this reserve combines the best barrels from the winery's three estate vineyards, which occupy three different sub-AVAs. Hence the Willamette Valley appellation. With excellent depth and power, it showcases a core of cherry, berry and chocolate, accented with sweet spices and a hint of fresh herb.",Trisaetum 2011 Estates Reserve Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This blend of Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is stellar given that 2011 was a cool year. Earthy aromas of wet clay, violet, blackberry and fresh herbs set up a balanced, ripe palate with flavors of plum, berry, mocha and vanilla. On the finish, tobacco, herbs, spice and vanilla flavors are textbook for the Alto Maipo, where this wine comes from. Drink through 2018.",Antiyal 2011 Red (Maipo Valley)
"Harvested at 40.16 Brix and retaining a whopping 255 g/L residual sugar, this wine shows a complex medley of notes ranging from fresh baked apple pie to apricot and cinnamon. It's thick and rich in feel with stone fruit and dried orange rind flavors persisting through the long-drawn-out finish.",Inniskillin 2007 Gold Icewine Vidal Blanc (Niagara Peninsula)
"So ripe and lush with fruit, this could only be from California. It assaults the palate with blackberries, cherries and mocha, but with an interesting, earthy green olive note. Oak adds predictable but rich notes of buttered toast. The tannins are soft enough for you to drink this lovely wine now, but you can age it for 6–8 years if you want.",Knights Bridge 2010 Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Sourced from an old parcel of Pinot Noir, this is a concentrated, dense wine with bold red-fruit flavors, a tight line of acidity and a dry, intense character. It hasn't lost its fruitiness and freshness, and should continue to improve till at least 2021.",Lamiable 2007 Cuvée Les Meslaines Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)

For a good introduction to the positives of Carmenère, try this.",Concha y Toro 2011 Serie Riberas Gran Reserva Ribera del Cachapoal Carmenère (Peumo)
"This is a remarkably well-composed wine full of ripe blackberry and cassis flavor accented by tart cranberry acidity and a rustic, brambly note. Complex, concentrated and elegant, it finishes with layers of granite and wet-stone minerality.",Damiani 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes)
"This Cabernet Franc-dominant blend, with additional splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec, leads with earthy tones of menthol, black-currant leaf and tobacco.

Drink now–2016.",Raats Family 2010 Red Jasper Red (Coastal Region)

The palate is slightly lush and creamy, but texturized by medium tannins and spicy accents of licorice and toast on the close.",Spier 2011 Vintage Selection Shiraz (Western Cape)
"Lamoreaux's standard-label Cabernet Franc spends 18 months in American oak, adopting layers of sweet spice, vanilla and smoke that penetrate deeply into its black cherry core. It's taut and unyielding on the palate, with bold acidity and big, brawny tannins, but should meld beautifully with 3–5 years in the cellar.",Lamoreaux Landing 2010 Estate Bottled Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes)
"This attractive, bright white opens with aromas of orange, green apple flesh and barely-ripe white peach. The light-weight mouth offers more of the same, alongside notes of melon rind and soft brioche. A slight creaminess is countered by brisk acidity, ending clean and refreshing. Drink now.",Morgenhof 2011 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Simonsberg-Stellenbosch)

"Though labeled Columbia Valley, this is in fact 100% Merlot from the estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's chewy and tannic, as is often the case with Red Mountain reds, with black cherry and cassis fruit wrapped by astringent tannins hinting at dark chocolate. In short, a fine steak wine, that needs some fat to cut the tannins.",Kiona 2010 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))

"This is an interesting wine for its earthy mushroom and tea flavors accenting a backdrop of strawberry jam. In its youth, the wine is dry, tannic and acidic, but it may well be an ager; give it six years to come around.",Les Belles Collines 2012 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This smooth, medium-bodied red combines Cabernet Sauvignon with Carignane, Merlot, Malbec and Syrah to satisfying effect. The Merlot and Malbec hail from the Russian River Valley's renowned Dakine Vineyard. It's soft in red cherry and blackberry fruit, but a structured wine with depth from leather and spice notes.",Longboard 2011 Point Break Red (North Coast)

Drink now through 2015.",Accadia 2011 Cantorì  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Raw-cut wood, vanilla, herbs and hard spice scents define the nose on this quality Carmenère. In the mouth, tomatoey acidity is offset by weighty berry fruit and creamy oak. Flavorwise, this is saucy, meaty, a touch stewy and herbal, just like the variety is known to be.",Arboleda 2011 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"A soft, light-footed entry is followed by extracted, yet still finely-knit tannins—presently, black cherry fruit is hidden behind them, but a juicy acidity promises they will come to the surface before long.",Birgit Braunstein 2011 Goldberg St. Laurent (Burgenland)
"Tasted alongside far more expensive Napa Cabs, this 100% varietal performed well. It's front loaded with blackberry jam that's jacked up with sweet, smoky oak. With a production of 15,000 cases, it's easy to find this smoothly tannic wine. Drink now.",Buehler 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

It is maturing well and already ready to drink, but it will also hold for several more years.",Cave de Kientzheim-Kaysersberg 2009 Late Harvest Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"This is a full, luscious and fruity wine, where the tannins linger behind the fruit profile. It has good weight, concentration, and delicate of wood aging. It should be aged longer before drinking, so wait until 2016.",Château de Calavon 2009 Cuvée Château Red (Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence)

"A very good value Carmenère with oak and charred aromas in front of berry, herbs and olive.

This quality makes for an interesting, food-friendly red that is further colored by tones of chocolate, leather and pipe tobacco. Pulpy, dark concentration is backed by drying tannins.",Monchiero Carbone 2008 Sru  (Roero)
"A tough, tannic wine, not showing much generosity due to the astringency. There's a great core of ripe, wild blackberries, blueberries, forest herbs and spices, but it is hard and somewhat rustic. A rich steak in blue cheese sauce will be a nice pairing. .",Paradise Ridge 2007 Elevation Cabernet Sauvignon (Rockpile)
"Dolan continues to produce stellar whites and reds from organically grown grapes in Mendocino County. This Chardonnay is ripe and full of minerality, a liquid form of crisp apple with vanilla on the finish.",Paul Dolan 2009 Chardonnay (Mendocino County)
Organic and biodynamic Punset offers Nebbiolo-based wines that are very difficult to assess. Try them too young (as in this case) and the wines often lack clarity and balance. Wait ten years or more and they blossom into something very special indeed. The 2008 Campo Quadro illustrates this point exactly.,Punset 2008 Campo Quadro  (Barbaresco)
"This is a gentle, soft Pinot Noir, dry and silky, offering classic flavors of cherries, raspberries, spices and smoky oak, housed in a good structure of tannins. It's a lovely wine to drink now with steak or lamb.",Robert Mondavi 2009 Pinot Noir (Napa Valley)
"This generous Syrah is reminiscent of a nice, rich Provençal wine. It's soft and spicy and fruity, with a good grip of tannin. The black raspberry, mulberry and cherry flavors are dusted with cinnamon and clove, and you'll find a coating of sweet, smoky oak. The vineyard is on Atlas Peak.",Stickybeak 2008 Syrah (Napa County)
"Here is a tight, traditional expression of Nebbiolo with a streamlined mouthfeel that is peppered with ripe fruit, licorice and root beer aromas. There's a note of bitterness and astringency on the close that will soften with time. Drink after 2018.",Villadoria 2008  Barbaresco
"A nicely balanced Pinot Noir from an unlikely spot––Portola Valley, on the western side of Highway 280 across from Stanford University––and a newish small producer. It's on the bigger side of the Pinot spectrum but has admirable texture and cherry and earth aromas. Only 130 cases made. Worth trying to see what unconventional areas can do with the variety.",Portola Vineyards 2008 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Clara Valley)
"Dark gold in color, this estate wine from hillside vines aged 11 months in one-third new French oak. Salty brine takes center stage before an unctuous pillow of caramel and honey rides along a full-bodied richness of flavor. A bright spark of lemony acidity marks the finish.",Ram's Gate 2014 Estate Chardonnay (Carneros)
"From Clare Ranch Vineyard in the Templeton Gap, this bottling by Ryan Render shows rounded notes of boysenberry and cooked blackberry on the nose alongside strong licorice and mocha aromas. Blackberry and boysenberry also arise on the sip, with olive, pepper and pretty violet floral flavors, all framed by a solidly dry structure.",Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 The Rocker Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"Bigger, richer, oaken and more structured than T-L's regular Châteauneuf-du-Pape, this cuvée flirts with being just too much. Vanilla, cedar and plum cake aromas, licorice, plum, and cocoa on the palate have a lot to recommend them, while the muscular midpalate and firmness of the tannins on the finish suggest agreeability but not much charm. Try after 2020?",Tardieu-Laurent 2013 Vieilles Vignes Red (Châteauneuf-du-Pape)
"At almost half Cabernet Franc (49%), this is slightly leafier than what most producers are pulling out of the Gimblett Gravels. The balance is Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), with small amounts of Merlot (9%) and Malbec (3%). The tobacco, chocolate and cassis notes are carried by medium body and a firm, dry texture. Drink 2019–2030.",Trinity Hill 2014 The Gimblett Gimblett Gravels Red (Hawke's Bay)
"The nose burgeons with so much ripeness of fruit, there is almost a hint of dried pear with a big dollop of spice. The palate shows the same generosity but is masterfully balanced by a lovely phenolic edge and zesty grapefruit freshness. White pepper shimmers in the background and makes for a very well-rounded, balanced, juicy and refreshing wine.",Türk 2015 Frechau Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"In marginal climates, what a difference a vintage can make. The 2015s from proprietor Sam Neill (yes, the actor) are a big step up from the 2014s. This bottling, from the Bannockburn subregion, offers bold notes of black cherries, plum and cola. It's a rich, ripe and powerful wine, with a long, intense finish that bodes well for cellaring. Drink now–2025.",Two Paddocks 2015 The Fusilier Proprietor's Reserve Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Beet and dark cranberry juice make for a very deep red-fruit entry to this bottling that is lifted by bay leaf, thyme and anise on the nose. It's easy, clean and refreshing in a lighter style on the sip, with dried strawberry and red plum spiced up by star anise and fennel.",Wrights Station 2013 Cave Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This red blend relies mostly on Cabernet Sauvignon, adding smaller amounts of Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Soft, spicy and impressively lengthy, it's highlighted in blackberry, currant and toasty oak, concentrated and complex.",Ziata 2013 Mia Madre Red (Napa Valley)
"Very ripe, almost candied notions of orange and mandarin peel determine the aromatic direction of this streamlined yet ripe Riesling. The flavors play along the entire ripe citrus spectrum: clementine and tangerine are there as well as pink grapefruit. The purity and subtlety, with hints of fragrant citrus leaves, make for a lasting impression and long finish.",Allram 2015 Gaisberg Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)

"“Wow” is the first word that comes to mind when tasting this superconcentrated and immensely fruity wine. It practically overwhelms the nose and the palate with ripe, jammy boysenberry and blackberry, sprinkled with licorice and black-pepper nuances that add attractive complexity. It's a big wine all the way, but not extreme in alcohol.",Artezin 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
"This blends 38% Merlot with 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc. Together these find a healthy companionship of wood, cedar, currant and dried herb, allowing the two Cabernets to speak loudest. Lightly spicy nutmeg and clove linger around well-defined layers of cherry and vanilla.",Blackbird Vineyards 2014 Arise Proprietary Red (Napa Valley)
"An almost honeyed nose tells of the 2015 ripeness, but instead leads to a concentrated palate that intriguingly combines peppery spice, savory herbs and rich mellow yeast. All this richness is tempered by a streamlined lemony acidity. This is savory, so make sure to pair it with subtle, expressive food. What a joy.",Brandl 2015 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Something tender and fresh rises from the glass: Fresh moss and green pear peel and a hint of citrus. The palate is light and bright, luminous almost, in its aromatics.

An homage to diversity, vanilla and peach purée tones add to the flavor of this richly rewarding, lively wine.",Iron Horse 2012 Rainbow Cuvée Estate Bottled Sparkling (Green Valley)
"Right from the start there is a supreme and appetizing tanginess to the fruit. The nose shows orange flesh and zest, the palate counters this with intense grapefruit zestiness. Between these poles there is ample, ripe and juicy citrus—think tangerine and orange. The finish is long, lip-smacking, totally refreshing and fruitful.",Jäger 2015 Achleiten Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"The rather closed nose gives little away. The palate, however, is full of juicy stone fruit. Think ripe mirabelle and apricot, think juicy tangerine and orange. This is full of fruit and tension, highlighted with lemon freshness and a lovely streamlined taut palate. The long finish has something of fresh apples about it.",Jäger 2015 Steinriegl Smaragd Riesling (Wachau)
"The 2015s Tavels are almost uniformly excellent, so it's no surprise that this bottling, from a large estate excels. Crushed stone and strawberry notes mark the nose, while the full-bodied palate folds in hints of savory, olive-like complexity. Drink now.",Château d'Aqueria 2015  Tavel
"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, leather and truffle take shape in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, orange zest, licorice, clove and coffee bean while notes of chopped mint lift the finish. Firm fine-grained tannins give it structure and finesse. Drink 2018–2028.",Fattoria La Lecciaia 2010 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"From a dry-farmed vineyard planted more than 50 years ago, this 100% varietal wine is highlighted in compost, leather and graphite.

"Flint and yeast vie with each other to give the first impression of this rich wine. The palate backs this up with concentration and a fluid, soft but defined texture. There is a streamline of lemon freshness at the core. This is like a powerful beast that has barely flexed its muscle. Let it come towards you.",R&A; Pfaffl 2015 Hundsleiten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel)
"Luscious and sleek in mouthfeel, and drenched with wonderful fruit flavors, this wine is a beauty. It has ample ripe fruit flavors like boysenberry and cherry pie without being literally sweet, while a sense of quiet concentration lasts on the lingering finish. It is structured with enough fine-grained tannin to age gracefully, so it's best to drink after 2019.",Rosenblum 2012 Carla's Reserve Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"An almost tropical touch of pineapple and passion fruit hovers over the glass. This is testament to the ripe 2015 vintage. The palate, however, reins in this fruity generosity with fresh, zesty notes of citrus, adding also a counterweight of textured phenolics. There is structure despite all the ripeness and ample refreshment, almost some grippiness. The zesty finish is very moreish.",Salomon-Undhof 2015 Von Stein Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"This perennial head-turner lives up to its pedigree in this vintage, offering a full-bodied, lush and plush experience characterized by soft layers of dark cherry, blackberry, vanilla and a seasoning of cinnamon. The vines are head-trained within a block planted to many other varieties, 15% of which make their way into this wine.",Stags' Leap Winery 2013 Ne Cede Malis Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Stags Leap District)
Generously ripe notions of yellow plum and juicy pear fill the nose. The palate benefits from the same fruitfulness but adds a touch of pepper and herbal savor at its concentrated core. There is something joyful about this. Despite the generous fruit this stays streamlined and supercrisp. The finish focuses on that wonderfully spicy pepperiness.,Steininger 2015 Loisium Weingarten Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)

"This wine is 100% varietal, aged entirely in French oak. Shy at first, it allows room for an earthy element of compost and is dark and brooding all around, with sizable, tamed, chalky tannin.

"Inky dark in the glass, this blend of 48% Syrah, 39% Grenache and 13% Mourvèdre offers up dense and potent blackberry and blueberry fruit aromas, enhanced by black pepper and bacon-fat richness. Blackberry fruit starts the sip and then it deepens into earth, tobacco and smoke. It's a fine study of darkness.",Écluse 2013 Rendition Red (Paso Robles)
"Toasty, warm, lusty dark-berry aromas are laced with a subtle animal accent. This is a big wine, with a fleshy, tannic, muscular feel. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and chocolate finish in fine form, with moderate tannic grip and all sorts of length. Drink this excellent Toro through 2022.",Elias Mora 2012 Crianza  (Toro)
"Tasted alongside the 2013, this is bigger, bolder, fruitier and more powerful, yet a touch less refined. The strawberry and cherry fruit is underscored with a pleasing minerality. The tannins are substantial and in proportion. A hint of chicken stock runs through the finish.",Elizabeth Chambers 2014 Winemaker's Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Earthy black-olive and foresty herbal scents accent core blackberry and moss aromas. Intense, juicy acidity gives this Cabernet blend vitality across the palate. Herbal berry, olive, pepper and tobacco flavors are spicy on a finish bolstered by brisk, powerful acidity. Drink through 2025.",Errazuriz 2013 Don Maximiano Founder's Reserve Red (Aconcagua Valley)
"Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe. This is less elegant and more blocky than most bottlings of Unico, but with ripe, loamy blackberry and plum flavors, it tastes great. A slightly hollow but round finish with mild residual tannins suggests that this be drunk now through 2024.",Vega Sicilia 2007 Unico  (Ribera del Duero)
"Cherry tomatoes, black olives, Kalamata olives, green olives, black pepper and dried herbs show on the nose of this zesty wine, done in a lavish not sparse manner. A rainbow of peppercorns pop on the palate, touching on the grape's herbaceous tendencies and showing tagine and tapenade flavors, but with tons of vibrancy and freshness. A well-done version of this flavor profile.",Waxwing 2014 Lester Family Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Made by brothers Scott and Gib Pagter, this rich wine is scented with sandalwood, strawberry, incense and chaparral shrub. There is a core of red cherry and ripe cranberry on the palate, where touches of sagebrush, eucalyptus and a strong minty freshness provide lots of energetic verve.",Pagter Brothers 2013 Pinot Noir (Paso Robles Willow Creek District)
"While low in alcohol and austere in dryness, there's a remarkable richness of texture that lends an impression of volume and density on the palate. Brisk notes of lemon and tart tangerine shine brightly, but are juxtaposed by an intensely stony, mineral finish. Drink now through 2020.",Peter Jakob Kühn 2014 Jacobus Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
"Sourced from vines almost 40-years-old, this is tight and spicy, with a potpourri of herbs from mint to tarragon to chive. The core of wild berry fruit is substantial. Don't miss the trailing finish. There's lots to taste in the tail of this comet.",Rex Hill 2013 Alpine Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Hay yellow in color, with a wispy shade of pink in the core, this bubbly shows aromas of lemon chiffon, sourdough toast, white peach and a touch of quinine on the nose. Lemon peel and curd show strongly on the palate, laid across a salted cracker flavor—quite delicious and refreshing at once.",Riverbench 2014 Cork Jumper Brut Rosé Sparkling (Santa Maria Valley)
"A clean and crisp style of Viognier, which comes in all forms these days, this bottling is light yet expressive on the nose with yellow grapefruit, lemon ice and a touch of chamomile tea. The palate is very grippy with crushed rocks, and also rich with buttered pear in the creamy, almost buttery midpalate, yet somehow remains lean and laser-focused.",Sanford 2013 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Viognier (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A 100% varietal wine aged in entirely new French oak, this is a big-bodied, grippy wine. It's slightly syrupy with ripe red fruit and a complexity of dried herb and cedar which makes it a fine representative of the relatively cooler appellation from which it comes.",Sodaro 2013 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville)
"Light black cherry, turned black loam and dried rose petals show on the nose of this straightforward and earthy bottling. Black raspberry and dark cranberry fruit consume the tart, edgy palate, with shaved licorice, sagebrush and a touch of pine needle completing the savory picture. A good lesson in fresh Mourvèdre.",Tablas Creek 2013 Mourvèdre (Adelaida District)
"Classic flavors, great structure and impressive depth make this wine tempting to drink now, but it will certainly improve with age. Hints of light nutmeg and coriander mingle with stronger blackberry and black pepper in the aromas and flavors. It has that slightly wild, gamey character of the Rhône, along with ripe but slightly restrained fruit and spices. Best from 2018 to 2023.",Terre Rouge 2013 Monarch Mine Vineyard Syrah (Sierra Foothills)
"Covila produces mostly good-quality affordable Rioja wines, but with this bottling the winery has stepped it up a notch. Aromas of raisin, graphite, prune, vanilla and coconut are ripe and oaky. A chunky, blocky, ripe palate holds blackberry and cassis flavors that come with notes of dried herbs. Chewy tannins and peppery spice push a bold finish. Drink through 2022.",Covila 2010 Pagos de Labarca  (Rioja)
"Whiffs of wood smoke, black pepper and clove bring an exotic touch to this dry, medium-bodied and tautly balanced wine. It stops just short of full ripeness, but has ample enough blackberry and black olive flavors to taste complete and to reverberate on the finish. It has great varietal character, and will be interesting to age through 2019.",Halcon 2013 Alturas Syrah (Yorkville Highlands)
"Old vines dating back to 1904 produce this unusually brawny late-harvest wine. It's deeply fruity, almost tropical in profile, bursting with sun-kissed mango and guava flavors. High-toned tangerine and grapefruit acidity lend balance, highlighting a delicately astringent, tea-toned finish. Drink now through 2025.",Kirsten 2013 1904 Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Dried black fruits, cedar, tobacco and just a few dried purple flowers show on this wine's slightly sour nose. The palate is a bit flat, with purple berries, tar and tobacco flavors that come and go quickly.",EOS 2012 Brohaugh Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
"This low-alcohol offering exhibits less weight and richness as a result. Still, it's a pleasant, lean white that relies on lemony flavors to provide crisp refreshment.",Brancott 2014 Flight Song Pinot Grigio (Marlborough)
"This 76% Cabernet Franc and 24% Malbec blend pushes the coolness of the vintage and the appellation in its extremely herbal, woody nose, a taste of bell pepper rising midway through its lean palate. It finishes round and soft.",Cairdean Estate 2011 Acquaintance Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Coombsville)
Stewed fig and blackberry aromas meet a dried herb accent on the nose. The full-bodied palate brings additional notes of blueberry jam blended with tarragon and marjoram. It's an easy sipper for a ruby Port-style wine made from Chambourcin.,St. Julian NV Cathermsn's Port (Lake Michigan Shore)
"A respectable effort, this offers attractive aromas of fig, melon and nectarine, but doesn't follow through with much intensity on the palate. It's light to medium in body, with hints of citrus pith and a bit of bitterness on the finish.",Stonecrop 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)
"This Bordeaux-style red blend from Northern Michigan sees 14 months in a mélange of oak: American, Hungarian and French. Charred red berries and cherries meet toasted savory herb notes on the nose. The medium-bodied palate brings fresher fruit tones, lightly supported by gossamer tannins and sharp acidity.",Mackinaw Trail 2012 Cabernet Merlot (Michigan)
"Vanilla candle wax, pollen and peaches-and-cream aromas are inviting and warm. The luscious body of juicy stone fruit is overcome by soapy floral notes on the midpalate, yet the persistent acid manages to clean up the flavors on the finish.",Brennan 2014 Reserve Viognier (Texas)
"Combine a cool year with cool-climate, single-vineyard origins and the result is this: olive, bell pepper and saucy tomato aromas, followed by a pointy, high-acid palate that's jagged in feel. Snappy red-plum and red-cherry flavors end with acid-driven crispness.",Lomas del Valle 2013 Coastal Cool Climate Single Vineyard Merlot (Casablanca Valley)
"Whiffs of balsamic vinegar and dusty minerals lend a savory, rustic tone to ripe black cherry and berry flavors in this full-bodied Syrah. The palate is concentrated, but it's a bit sharp and unrefined. The finish is modest.",Lucas Vineyards 2013 Limited Reserve Syrah (Finger Lakes)
"This is a light, clear and straightforward wine, reduced somewhat on the nose, and exhibiting a tight, tannic structure and backbone of oak. Black cherry and blackberry dominate in flavor, with a full-bodied feel.",MacMurray Estate Vineyards 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Bread and yeast notes are up front while the full-bodied palate offers adequate acidity that maintains freshness. Melon, papaya and peach flavors finish clean, but with no complexity.",Indomita NV Brut  (Casablanca Valley)
"There's a chalky tartness to this young wine, a single-vineyard designate from a consistent source. Gravenstein apple and a suggestion of honey star on the nose and palate around a medium body and finish.",Krutz 2014 Magnolia Inspiration Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"This fruity wine has soft and tannins and a jammy backdrop. It is ripe and full in the mouth with strawberry and red plum jelly flavors. Drink now. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership.",Labouré-Roi 2014  Bourgogne
"An earthy rusticity marks this wine, soft in black cherry, with a rich, smooth texture and grippy, tongue-coating finish of leathery tannin.",Wellington 2010 Mohrhardt Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"Aromas of tire rubber and plum lead to soft, sweet cherry and mocha flavors. It's a solid, easy drinker.",David James 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Tart cherry, tobacco and leather present themselves on the nose, leading the way to fruit forward flavors of red plum and cherry pie backed by pleasant hints of vanilla.",Cramele Recas 2014 Dreamfish Cabernet Sauvignon (Viile Timisului)
"Full bodied and quite ripe, this wine has a taste of Good & Plenty licorice around a core of vanilla custard and toasty oak. It is 100% varietal.",Dusk to Dawn 2013 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Easy-going in spite of full body, this warm and generous wine is full of ripe fruit flavors and has a smooth texture. The fresh cherry and raspberry flavors are tasty and satisfying, while very light tannins keep the mouth-feel soft.",Eagle Canyon 2013 Pinot Noir (California)
"Citron, lemon rind and pastry crust aromas travel to a vigorous palate of foaming bubbles and racing acidity. A sweet plastic note meets a squeeze of lemon on the finish.",Gruet NV Blanc de Blancs Sauvage Chardonnay (America)
"Quinteto is a Cabernet Franc-led blend of five grapes, including Syrah, Merlot, Malbec and Pinot Noir. It opens with scratchy raspberry and herbal aromas that turn murkier with time. Briny flavors of olive and herbal plum carry onto the finish.",Lomas del Valle 2012 Quinteto Coastal Cool Climate Red (Casablanca Valley)
"This wine has a deep-gold color, attractive baking-spice and buttered popcorn aromas, appealing apple and pear flavors and medium body. The texture is soft and easy and the acidity tastes low.",Earth's Harvest 2014 Organic Grapes Chardonnay (California)
"Murky, mulchy aromas of baked black fruits and coffee grinds set up a gritty, hard palate of barrel char and roasted berry fruits. The finish is more of the same—lots of oak, burnt coffee and baked black-fruit flavors.",Falernia 2013 Pedriscal Vineyard Reserva Carmenère (Elqui Valley)
"Scattered aromas of black olive and stewed berry fruits lead to a heavy, awkward palate. This tastes strained, with burnt, leafy black-fruit flavors and a soft, low-acid finish.",François Lurton 2013 Gran Aracauno Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"There are lots of dried tones to the nose: herbs, meat and hay. The palate shows more fruit, with tart cherry and raspberry flavors giving a snappy resistance to the grippy, sandy tannins.",Nevada Ridge 2011 Barbera (Nevada)
"This brut sparkler is made from Chambourcin, a hybrid grape of uncertain parentage. Fresh figs and dates come to mind on the nose, while the linear palate is persistently citrus-driven.",Illinois Sparkling Co. NV Franken's French Hybrid Brut Sparkling (Illinois)
"This Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère blend is a green machine with a pyrazine-led explosion of green bean and bell pepper aromas. Robust and grabby on the palate, this tastes heavily of herbal plum and canned green bean, while a minty finish includes flavors of olive and bitterness. This feels right but smells and tastes extremely green.",Balduzzi 2010 B Red (Maule Valley)
The lemony freshness that the nose promises is slightly unbalanced on the bright palate but the flavors are clean and invigorating. This easydrinking wine would make a perfect party apéritif.,Gustave Lorentz 2014 Riesling (Alsace)
"This is an overtly oaky Cabernet with resiny, balsamic aromas that share space with baked black-fruit scents. The palate feels flabby and fat, with modest tannic grip. Jammy blueberry and cassis flavors end oaky, resiny and jammy.",Indomita 2014 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"Whiffs of nuts, dusty mineral and lemon are demure on the nose, but become more concentrated on the palate of this dry white. A blend of Chardonnay, Riesling and Grüner Veltliner, it's more minerally than fruity, but refreshing and brisk.",Inspire Moore 2014 Gratitude White (Finger Lakes)
"Some will find this Chardonnay severe and lacking in richness as it's marked by dryness, minerality and acidity, rather than tropical fruit and sweet oak.It would not be surprising if this wine made gains in 5–6 years, but even if it doesn't, it defines a more elegant style.",Thomas Fogarty 2009 Albutom Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"There's lots of mouthwatering acidity in this bone-dry Pinot Noir, with an ample supply of ripe fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries. There's also something wonderfully earthy, like roasted mushrooms splashed with balsamic and tamari sauce. The cool 2010 vintage was kind to Bacigalupi Vineyard, which can produce overripe wines in hot years.",Von Holt 2010 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A wonderful wine, one of the best Petite Verdots in California, although the truth is there aren't all that many. It's sturdy in tannins and richly textured, with delicious blackberry flavors that are a little earthier and drier than Cabernet Sauvignon.",Kunde 2009 Limited Selection Petite Verdot (Sonoma Valley)
"Whatever the blend is on this red wine, and winemaker Heidi Barrett isn't saying, it's really interesting. The bottle is old-fashioned and stubby, like something from the 1700s. The wine itself is immediately likeable for its spicy array of spices and berries. Despite its upfront appeal, there's a complexity that elevates it.",La Sirena 2009 Pirate TreasuRed Red (Napa Valley)
"This is White Oak's best Chardonnay in years. The wine benefited from the chilly vintage, expressing citrus and tropical fruit flavors while preserving its vital acidity. It shows real elegance.",White Oak 2010 Estate Grown Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Insanely rich, this explodes in the mouth with orange, pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and sweet new-oak flavors. The richness is tempered with crisp acidity and a minerality that tastes like a lick of cold steel. This is a good price for a Santa Lucia Chardonnay this rich and appealing.",Windstream 2010 Sarmento Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is the current release from Guigal, which makes it one of the few Hermitages on store shelves that's ready to drink. It's medium to full in weight, chunky and assertive, but not overly concentrated or tannic. Instead, it delivers beefy notes of coffee, black olive and spice, backed by hints of raspberries and cedar.",E. Guigal 2006  Hermitage
"This is made in a ripe, high-alcohol style, which gives it a little burning sensation, like Cognac. The flavors certainly are delicious, exploding with blackberries, blueberries, dark chocolate and roasted oak. The tannin-acid structure is intricate and smooth.",a-non-ah-mus 2009 Alisos Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
"The Pocai Vineyard is a very interesting one, growing Chenin Blanc, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and the wines are always worth looking into. This Cabernet Franc, at four years of age, is mellowing, with the tannins turning gentle and the flavors becoming delicious and dramatic. Particularly bright in red cherries, it's a beautiful wine for drinking over the next year or two.",Ballentine 2008 Estate Grown Pocai Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley)
"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge. Drink now–2015.",Trapiche 2008 Gran Medalla Malbec (Mendoza)
"Delicious and crisp in acidity, this is dry despite its flavors of honey and ripe, jammy tropical fruit. How this wine achieves such a quality is magic, but the brisk acidity helps, as does its stony minerality. Ready to enjoy now.",Stephen Ross 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyards Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Earthy aromas are a hallmark of the Baga grape, a component of this full-bodied, tannic blend. With weight and richness, a mint note and new wood flavors, it is a serious wine that still should develop over three years.",Caves Aliança 2007 Quinta das Baceladas Red (Bairrada)
"This opens with persuasive aromas of wild berry and cassis before cola and leather notes enter. It's a powerfully built Malbec with bright acidity, strong bones and pure, bold flavors of blackberry and black cherry. This is youthful and more fruit focused than the oakier DJN 2006 Reserva Malbec.",Cielo y Tierra 2007 Don Juan Nahuel Malbec (Mendoza)
"A consummate Russian River Pinot Noir in an accessible style. This is simply enchanting, like raspberry-infused silk dusted with brown butter, cinnamon and vanilla. Showing just beautifully now, this is soft and gentle, and it should glide through the next six years.",Davis Family 2009 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"A beautiful Pinot to drink now, this is elegant and supple, with crisp acidity and a delightfully light texture. However, there's nothing light about the flavors, which suggest wild forest berry, softened cola, mushroom, dried pine and spice, enhanced with a subtle jacket of sandalwood.",Freeman 2010 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Fresh, floral and not overbearing on the nose, this has red berry and cassis aromas, with no interference from oak or too much extraction. It feels pure and elegant, with wild berry and cherry flavors that end on a ripe, slightly sweet-tasting finish. Good for near-term drinking.",Clos Gebrat 2010 Red (Priorat)
"This smells like orange marmalade. It feels smooth and creamy, but not terribly thick due to fine acidity, with flavors of orange, honey, peach and spice. Long and creamy on the finish, this is a fresh, delicious wine that should impress anyone with a sweet tooth.",Ochoa 2010 Vino Dulce Moscatel (Navarra)
"Despite this wine's thick veneer of toasty, vanilla-scented oak, it has plenty of underlying fruit, powerful enough to handle the wood. It's full bodied, dense and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish redolent of blackberries and cedar. Approachable now, but should easily age through 2025.",Paul Jaboulet Aîné 2009 Domaine de Thalabert  (Crozes-Hermitage)
"From one of Italy's most important showcase designer wineries, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot lives up to its super Tuscan celebrity. It is gently redolent of dark chocolate, ripe fruit, leather, tobacco and crushed black pepper—the bouquet's elegant moderation is one of its strongest points. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy and long. Drink after 2018.",Petra 2008 Petra Red (Toscana)
"This ruby-colored Brunello opens with notes of fresh fruit, forest floor, cedar wood, exotic spice and blackberry preserves. It shows a bright berry mouthfeel, with cherry intensity and a clean, fresh finish.",Pietroso 2007  Brunello di Montalcino
"A beautiful Cabernet, this has all the hallmarks of a fine wine. It's dry, rich in tannins and elegant, with long, deep flavors of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate. It's already throwing some sediment, so give it a careful decant.",Korbin Kameron 2007 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)
"This wine's most outstanding quality is the elegant and delicate manner with which the bouquet slowly reveals itself. This vineyard-designate wine is a traditional blend of Sangiovese and Canaiolo, opening with subtle aromas of red cherry, dried violet, moist earth, vanilla and cured meat.",Lungarotti 2007 Rubesco Riserva Vigna Monticchio Red (Torgiano)
"Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.",Migration 2010 Charles Heintz Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)
"Rich doesn't begin to describe the layers of flavor and texture. This wine is massive, with notes of tropical fruit and apricot, with a slightly botrytized character that Sleepy Hollow Chardonnays often display. The oak is lavish and buttery, but perfectly matched to the wine's volume. It also has classic Monterey acidity—as pert as a squeeze of lime. Delicious, full bodied and exotic, it defines its vineyard and appellation.",Pessagno 2010 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Fragrant with floral notes, lemony fruit and hints of apricot, this is a tangy, textural take on Pinot Gris. Fermented in stainless steel and released young, it retains a bright and stylish profile right through a lingering finish, with a touch of sweetness.",Ponzi 2011 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"This has a pretty light color, with dry raspberry and citrus scents. The palate is pure and elegant, with tangerine, grapefruit and nectarine flavors. This finishes longer than most, with poise and grace.",Raventós I Blanc 2009 de Nit Sparkling (Cava)
"Fogarty continues its streak of great, Chablis-style Chardonnays with this single-vineyard bottling. True afficionados will love the dryness, acidity and minerality, which give it such great structure. The severity is relieved by flavors of citrus zest and white peach, and the creamy sourdough richness imparted by lees aging. Try aging it for at least six years.",Thomas Fogarty 2009 Langley Hill Vineyard Estate Grown Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This full-bodied, creamy Crozes-Hermitage far outpaces expectations for the appellation, combining cherry-berry fruit with cracked pepper, mocha and licorice. Then it finishes long, anchored by a marriage of fruit and spice. It's ready to drink now, but should evolve positively through at least 2017.",Maison Nicolas Perrin 2009  Crozes-Hermitage
"What sets this wine apart is its gorgeous, creamy intensity on the finish. Made from Trebbiano, this expression shows the qualitative heights this variety can achieve. Notes of vanilla cream, peach cobbler, dried sage and pineapple appear on the bouquet. The finish is long and full. Try aging this for five years or longer.",Masciarelli 2008 Castello di Semivicoli  (Trebbiano d'Abruzzo)
"Lovely, crisp acidity marks this dry, complex Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but very elegant, with delicate sour-cherry candy, cola and mushroom flavors. A great wine to serve with mushroom-based entrées.",Beaulieu Vineyard 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Crisp green aromas suggest lime and then passion fruit. It's lively and spritzy in the mouth, with high acidity yielding green flavors that transition to pithy and heavy. Lemon-lime mixed with celery notes come up on the finish.",Matetic 2010 EQ Sauvignon Blanc (San Antonio)
"Smoky, dark and rich, this oak-aged Ripasso is packed tight with savory aromas of barbecue smoke, bresaola, licorice and sun-dried fruit. There's a sweet note on the close followed by smooth, soft tannins.",Montezovo 2009  Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso
"Toasty, minty and sweet smelling. The palate is dark, full and choppy feeling, with cola, coconut, mint, blackberry and cassis flavors. There's good power and depth to this Malbec; a bit rough and herbal at the finish line.",Odfjell 2009 Orzada Malbec (Lontué Valley)
"Aromas of cedar and damp soil lend a clean, foresty air to this beautifully ripe yet restrained Bordeaux blend. Black fruit flavors are intensely concentrated yet brisk with acidity, strident grape tannins and a lingering granite finish.",Pellegrini Vineyards 2005 Reserve Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"This medium-bodied Riesling shows some already-evolving notes of honey, truffle and petrol wrapped around its core of apple and citrus. Seems a little on the sweeter side of the trocken spectrum.",Prinz Salm 2009 Wallhausen Johannisberg GG Trocken Riesling (Nahe)
"Earthy, warm and generously oaked, with berry aromas that bring leather and smoke. The palate is healthy and tight, with spiky tannins and herbal black fruit flavors. Grippy on the finish, with olive and spice. Very much a good-quality, typically styled Chilean Cabernet.",Montes 2009 Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Shines with a nice purple lustre then opens with big blackberry and spiced plum flavors that are earthy and wild. The palate is round, ripe and feels good, and the flavors are centered on herbal blackberry and toast. Very good for the price range.",MontGras 2010 Reserva Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"A largely unfruity wine, defined by mineral notes of struck flint and crushed stone. Yet at the same time, it's ripe in weight and mouthcoating in its intensity, hinting at orange oil on the long finish.",Peter Jakob Kühn 2009 Landgeflecht Trocken Riesling (Rheingau)
A lightly golden Viognier very floral in jasmine and white peach. It's sweet at first but minerally in the finish and subtle for what can be an overbearing variety at times.,Philo Ridge 2009 Nelson Ranch Viognier (Mendocino)
"A beautifully drinkable rosé sparkling wine for opening now. It's soft and honeyed, with fine bubbles framing slightly sweet flavors of raspberries, cherries, brioche, vanilla and toast.",Schramsberg NV Mirabelle Brut Rosé Sparkling (North Coast)
"Pretty much a near replica of the winery's previous vintage, a sound, clean and dry Cabernet for drinking soon. It's rich in tannins, with varietally proper flavors of blackberries, black currants, plums and cedar. Give it a good decant before pouring.",Titus 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"An intensely rich wine from vines planted on chalk soil. There is a spicy, smooth texture, with a bitter almond and cinnamon edge. The alcohol does leave a burning sensation, which detracts from the overall feel.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2009 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Certainly rich, but this wine is also about purity of spicy fruit, bringing out the fresher side of the variety as well as the intensity.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2009 Gewürztraminer (Alsace)
"It's labeled dry, but this wine comes across as just slightly off dry, with ripe melons and pears taking the lead and never looking back. It's plump on the palate, finishing with a teasing sense of sugar. Drink now.",Dr. Loosen 2009 Red Slate Dry Riesling (Mosel)
"Leather and woody/smoky aromas blend well with core cassis and berry scents. The palate feels fresh and healthy, with cassis, raspberry, herb and olive flavors. Tones it down on the finish, which is dry and tastes of carob and minty green herbs.",Echeverria 2009 Family Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Curicó Valley)
"If there's any quibble with this wine, it's that the aromas and flavors remain in a very narrow range, from struck flint to citrus. Otherwise, it's a lovely dry Riesling, slightly plump and custardy on the palate yet crisp and sharply focused on the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",Fitz-Ritter 2009 Dürkheimer Rittergarten Kabinett Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"No doubt, this is a big, bold wine that hits the palate like a ton of bricks. Aromas include maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit and plum, spice and leather. Not surprisingly, it delivers loads of sticky chewiness as well.",Gino Fasoli 2006 Corte del Pozzo  (Amarone della Valpolicella)
"There's a distinctive touch of dark cola and licorice here that frames a solid core of blackberry and cherry liqueur. The wine is darkly concentrated with firm tannins and a soft, sweet endnote of mature fruit and cinnamon spice.",Viviani 2007  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"Comes across as rather round and lush on the palate, with tropical fruit flavors of guava and pineapple. It's easy to drink and enjoy for its fruity immediacy and mouthwatering finish.",A. Christmann 2009 Gimmeldinger Biengarten Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)
"An individualistic, some would say eccentric wine, made from grapes grown all over the valley. Your first impression is of jammy sweetness: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, oak. Then the tannins kick in, bringing needed dryness. Shows the ripeness of Napa Valley Cabernet, but doesn't seem like an ager. Drink now–2014.",Altvs 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Bixio offers a tight, compact expression of Amarone that seems bursting at the seams with fresh fruit, cherry and berry aromas. The wine is syrupy and thick in the mouth with a refreshing touch of acidity at the close.",Bixio 2008  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico
"This wine requires decanting, as it seems to have entered a dumb phase. But there is clearly a good core of blackberry and black cherry fruit, lightly dusted with fresh herb.",Brooks 2008 Janus Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Somewhat soft and jammy. While it's certainly delicious, this 100% Cabernet needs greater structure and complexity to add value to the sweet blackberries, cherries and chocolate.",Stepping Stone by Cornerstone 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Feels too soft and rather one-dimensional, although the flavors are very good. The best thing about the wine, aside from dryness, is the richness of tannins. The fruit veers toward blackberry marmalade and currants. Doesn't seem like an ager, so drink up.",Tercero 2007 Thompson Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)
This is an informal and fresh Cabernet that would pair perfectly with easy pasta dishes or lasagna. Aromas include black cherry and plum and the wine offers a polished and compact feel overall.,Tommasi 2008 Poggio al Tufo  (Maremma)
"A delicate but complex nose of peony, bergamot, Anjou pear and hard melon transition to a somewhat surprisingly lean mouth flooded with citrus flavors. The nuances of the bouquet are mostly missing on the palate, but this remains a clean and refreshing white.",Les Deux Rives 2009 Blanc White (Corbières)
"Gets the job done with its rich tannins, crisp acids and solid blackberry, mocha and orange zest flavors. Easy to drink, and ready now. Production was 1,685 cases.",Morgan 2008 Syrah (Monterey)
"A bit unusual and confusing, but that's because it hails from the Rioja region. The nose is herbal and mustardy, with green aromas leading to a cidery palate of apples and spice. There's also a bit of lemon and creaminess to this cava. Hard to understand but not without its merits.",Muga NV Casa Conde de Haro Sparkling (Cava)

"With a light, silky texture, this Pinot glides over the palate, carrying rich fruit and spice flavors. They include raspberries, pomegranates, cola, red licorice, cinnamon and pepper. It's lovely in many respects, but it's also notably sharp in acidity, a problem that's unlikely to go away.",Casa Torres 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)

"After the scent of char blows off a bit, this first harvest Merlot opens sweetly to aromas of vanilla, cinnamon spice and plush, red plums. There's a hint of green stalks and leaves detectable on the palate amidst underripe black cherry and plum flavors, but bright acidity gives this wine a fresh character and the spiced plum finish is pleasant.",Comtesse Thérèse 2005 First Harvest Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"The nose offers plenty of cooked plum preserves, warm spice and toasted, nutty oak. There's a nice, lush texture and body, and bright red cherry and plums flavors on the palate.

"Spy Valley's 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir is an attractive wine, featuring an exterior of brown sugar, dry leaves and coffee and a fruit-filled cherry center. The only concern is the slightly drying finish and some slightly coarse, rustic tannins. If those resolve gracefully, this rating may look stingy in 3 years' time.",Spy Valley 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"Mostly Sangiovese with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, this informal wine offers freshness and simplicity. You'll recognize balanced aromas of red fruit, spice, leather and a touch of chewy pipe tobacco.",Ciacci Piccolomini d'Aragona 2007 Red (Toscana)

Aged 24 months in new French oak.",Comtesse Thérèse 2004 Château Reserve Merlot (North Fork of Long Island)
"As sharp, fresh and fruity as a jar of raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam, melted into liquid and fortified with alcohol. Feels hot, too, despite an official alcohol reading of just 14%. The winery held this back for five years, an expensive investment in storage, but the wine just can't quite overcome its limitations.",EOS 2005 Cupa Grandis Grand Barrel Reserve Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)
Here's an easy Sangiovese-based wine (with a small percent of Petit Verdot for extra darkness and color) that would pair wonderfully with stay-home pizza or pasta. The wine offers bright berry nuances of cherry and raspberry and a touch of distant spice and smoke on the fade.,Fattoria Scopone 2006 Il Gregoriano Red (Sant'Antimo)
"Sweet and a little grassy on the nose, with lemon-lime aromas. The palate has a solid, regular, friendly feel along with sweet flavors of white nectarine, apple juice and tarragon.

"This variety is an extreme rarity in this appellation. This one offers aromas of wet penny, spice and red fruit. The palate is medium bodied, with the tannins bringing some grit.",Liberty Lake 2012 Tempranillo (Red Mountain)
"This is a dark, intensely astringent wine with so much grape and oak tannin that it's challenging to enjoy now. Since PV is known as a grape that provides color and tannin in Bordeaux wines, it's no wonder that it's so stiff today. It will drink best after 2020.",Parducci 2013 Reserve Petit Verdot (Mendocino)
"Made entirely with Trebbiano and vinified in oak, this opens with aromas of mature orchard fruit, citrus, chopped herb and a whiff of toast. The linear, rather lean palate offers toasted almond, coffee, oak and green pear.",Pieve de' Pitti 2013 Tribiana Trebbiano (Toscana)

It has a touch of tannin as well as minerality. Drink from late 2017.",Georges Duboeuf 2015 Château de Nervers  (Brouilly)
"This is a family-owned estate whose wines is made by Georges Duboeuf. It is structured and firmly concentrated, more tannin than fruit.

"This varietal Sauvignon Gris isn't as aromatic as the more pungent Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, this is medium in body, with good overall texture.

"Almond, toast, vanilla bean and other oak-related aromas drive the nose of this vibrant Riserva from one of the most beautiful estates in Radda-in-Chianti.

The high alcohol, moderate acidity and richly concentrated fruit give the impression of sweetness on the long finish.",Villa Maria 2007 Reserve Sauvignon Blanc (Wairau Valley)
"Backsberg's wines have style, and this Chenin is another in a line of successes. An assertive nose of pear, apple, honey and flowers leads a wine offering lovely citrus and floral flavors, cut slightly with a dancing acidity. The wine has dimension but a fresh edge.",Backsberg 2007 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"More oak and color than the regular Calina Merlot, but that means more coconut, resin and char as well.

"This wine ultrarich—perhaps too much so. With intense apricot and spice flavors, it's a dense powerhouse of bitter botrytis that lacks elegance. Although it will soften with time, the superripe character will remain.",Château les Roques 2013  
"This second wine of this estate is aged in tank, making it all bright, ripe berry fruit and juicy acidity. The tannins are still there as it's still aging. Give this attractive, fruity wine until late 2018 before opening.",Château Roc de Boissac 2014 La Millerie  (Puisseguin Saint-Émilion)

"This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, sends up toasty aromatics richly imbued with the scents of new oak. John Bookwalter consistently makes wines in this style, which in a cooler year such as 2010, can seem to mask the fruit.

"If fruit were the only thing that counted, this Pinot would get a perfect score, with an upfront burst of cherries, strawberries and raspberries.

"Of the various Huber Pinot Noirs, this is the one most in need of 2–3 years of cellaring. Some pungent cabbage and cedar aromas should be better integrated by then, and the firm tannins now evident on the finish should also be at least partially resolved. Right now, there's a hint of silkiness and some nice plum and sous-bois notes that should only improve over the short term.",Huber 2005 Hecklinger Schlossberg R Trocken Spätburgunder (Baden)
"Here's a big, rich, thick Pinot that almost seems more like a southern Rhône wine, it's that dark and full-bodied. The flavors are ripe and jammy, of pie-filling black cherries, black raspberries, cola, anise and smoky oak.",Keller Estate 2006 Precioso Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Here's a cheerful and beautifully aromatic blend of Pinot Grigio, Traminer and Riesling that boasts both freshness and complexity. The Pinot Grigio gives it weight and structure and the other two varieties create a fragrant bouquet of stone fruit and white flowers.",Lis Neris 2006 Confini White (Venezia Giulia)
"Shows the classic structure of a fine Russian River Pinot, and Merry Edwards' way of making everything elegant. Dry and crisp, the wine displays cherry pulp and skin, cola, anise and spice flavors, wrapped into ultra-refined, velvety tannins. Doesn't seem to have the fruity focus and concentration of recent vintages, though, so drink soon.",Merry Edwards 2006 Olivet Lane Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Shows the mushroomy, earthier side of New Zealand Pinot Noir, but does it very well, backing up those flavors with plenty of weight and intensity as well as cola-tinged dark fruit. Ends with some slightly coarse tannins, so put it away for a couple of years, or serve with a charred dry-aged steak.",Nanny Goat 2006 Pinot Noir (Central Otago)
"Bring on the cheeseburgers! This is an outrageously delicious, easy-drinking Zin that will fall in love with charbroiled beef and melted cheese. It's not a terribly complicated wine, but perfect for immediate enjoyment with comfort foods.",Ottimino Vineyards 2005 Rancho Bello Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"A live-wire wine with baby powder, tropical fruit, citrus and green melon on the nose. Made in the forward, fruit-first style; it radiates with natural acidity such to the point that it's borderline aggressive. But with such power you also get strong green apple and grapefruit flavors. Edgy and citric overall, but at the same time you won't get shorted.",Cono Sur 2008 Visión Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)

It's fresh and forward, with angularity and strong varietal character.",Errazuriz 2008 Estate Sauvignon Blanc (Casablanca Valley)
"This is a dark, huge Pinot Noir, so rich and opulently fruity that it might almost be a Grenache. It has a thick, soft mouthfeel, and is explosive in cherry jam, red licorice and mocha flavors that are utterly delicious. However, there's a certain direct appeal that lacks complexity and nuance. Drink now and over the next few years.",Etude 2006 Deer Camp Pinot Noir (Carneros)

"Eberle's Sangioveses are always dry, acidic and cherried. On their own, they're tight, rustic little monsters. Drink them with appropriate fare, and suddenly you're in Tuscany.

It's dancingly light in body yet surprisingly powerful in concentration.",Standing Stone 2013 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"100% varietal with the majority of the fruit coming from Weinbau Vineyard, it brings notes of plum, whole green pepper and coffee.

Perhaps some additional time in the bottle with smooth it out.",Tamarack Cellars 2012 Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope)
"Savory aromas of bay leaf and fennel pair with mushrooms and freshly turned dirt on this single-vineyard wine.

The toffee is more obvious than the honey, but this remains a fresh, vivid wine.",Domaine Philippe Delesvaux 2005 Sélection de Grains Nobles Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon)
"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine. It has the structure of a gentle Merlot, but with the wild cherry and raspberry, date nut cake, cocoa, pepper and clove flavors that make it so distinctive and savory. This is consistently one of the best Zins from the RRV.",Dutton-Goldfield 2006 Morelli Lane Vineyard Zinfandel (Russian River Valley)
"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine.",Baileyana 2006 Grand Firepeak Cuvée Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"Puy means a hill, and the steep slopes of the Côte du Puy offer great exposure for the vines. The result is a densely structured, very muscular wine that shows richness as well as dark tannins. The aftertaste is sweet, streaked with acidity.",Domaine Jean Foillard 2006 Côte du Puy  (Morgon)
"A big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet. This is a wine that could be enjoyed now, but would certainly age over the next 4–5 years.",Quinta do Passadouro 2005 Red (Douro)
"Compared to Felsina's other Riserva from the same vintage, Rancia offers more evident use of oak and is shaped by natural aromas of bright berry and supple notes of vanilla and spice. There's also an earthy tone that recalls the beautiful territory of Castelnuovo Berardenga. It is succulent and sophisticated and has a long menthol-driven finish.",Felsina 2004 Riserva Rancia  (Chianti Classico)
"Showing the rustic tannins and peppery spices that Dry Creek Cabs usually possess, this Cab wants a little time in the cellar. With black currant, chocolate, tobacco and herb flavors, it's very close in quality to the winery's regular '05 Cab, with a little more concentration and a firmer tannin structure.",Fritz 2005 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins. Not a long-term ager, but should hold for 6 years, and is easy to find, with more than 13,000 cases produced.",Chateau St. Jean 2004 Cinq Cepages Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)
"This is the winery's flagship wine, the one that made it famous decades ago. It hasn't changed much over the years. It's still tannic and austere in youth, requiring many years to develop. But it's a cellar guarantee, with a wealth of concentrated cassis and cedar flavors that are just waiting for those tannins to drop out. Best after 2010.",Clos du Val 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"There's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice. The wine is attractively edged with wood, giving a fine, ripe finish.",Domaine Chignard 2006 Cuvée Spéciale  (Fleurie)
"The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years.",Paul Dolan 2005 Deep Red Red (Mendocino)
"Here's a savory, delicious and varietally true Pinor Noir that drinks well right away, but has the structural integrity for the cellar. With crisp, dry flavors of cherries, pomegranates, cola, tobacco and Chinese five-spice, it appeals for its exotic immediacy, but has the density to evolve for 5 or 6 years.",Pessagno 2006 Lucia Highlands Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Aged in wood, this cuvée is powerful, ripe and intense. The jellied red fruits are all sweet and rich, touched by acidity but mainly with good depth of flavor and structure. It would even be worth aging this for another year.",Château du Châtelard 2006 Cuvée Tradition  (Fleurie)
"This bottling continues to impress after all these years with its complexity and sheer deliciousness. The '06 shows charred barrel fermentation notes of pungent, smoky wood, but there's a great heart of citrus, melon and pepper spice flavors that makes the wine rich and rewarding. It's made even better by zesty acidity and a bone-dry finish.",Chateau St. Jean 2006 La Petite Etoile Fumé Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"There's a very attractive fullness and roundness to this wine that wins over your senses the moment you lift the glass to your nose. The wine delivers aromas of black cherry, Asian spice, root beer, vanilla and sweet maple syrup that are distinct and pristine. It's modern and velvety in the mouth with tight structure and great length.",Dievole 2004 Riserva Novecento  (Chianti Classico)
"Gamay often becomes more like Pinot Noir as it ages. That's true of this wine, which displays strawberry and spice flavors, as well as an element of minerality. The aftertaste has ripe blackberry jelly.",Domaine Chignard 2005 Cuvée Spéciale  (Fleurie)
"There's something tight and minerally and acidic about this Chardonnay that will appeal to connoisseurs of austere wines. Even though the oak is nearly one-half new, the wine has a lean, lemony taste, with nuances of crème brûlée and roasted hazelnuts. Defines food-friendly elegance, and could develop bottle complexity over the next 5 years.",Merryvale 2005 Chardonnay (Carneros)
There's a distinctive mineral aspect that sets this wine apart. Those aromas recall white stone or slate and enhance the wine's elegance and food pairing potential. The mouth is bright and ripe with red cherry and fresh berry notes on the close. It would pair well with braised meat.,Ruffino 2004 Riserva Ducale Oro  (Chianti Classico)
"Deep concentration and color set the stage and are followed by warm tones of black cherry, spice, leather, molasses, maple syrup and tobacco. This Riserva, with 5% Merlot, has a plush, velvety edge that is backed by nicely formed tannins and a chewy, succulent texture.",San Fabiano Calcinaia 2005 Riserva Cellole  (Chianti Classico)
"Dark and rich, with aromas of cola and coffee and flavors of plum and cola. This is full-bodied, its 14.5% alcohol balanced by fruit intensity and richly textured tannins and the long finish. Drink 2010–2020.",Shingleback 2005 D Block Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"Although this winery is better known for its Shiraz, I have been a consistent fan of its Riesling as well. The 2006 offers scents of powdered minerals and lime followed by flavors of apple and citrus. It's medium-bodied but muscular, with plenty of intensity that comes through on the long finish. Drink now–2016.",Mount Langi Ghiran 2006 Riesling (Victoria)
"Balsam, lush prune and all sorts of earthy, interesting aromas set this rich, ripe Carmenère off on a wild ride. Chocolate greets you at the front door, with deep plum and berry waiting behind. It's saturated and superripe but it doesn't lose step or steam. Excellent in the ultraripe, modern style.",Odfjell 2005 Orzada Carmenère (Maule Valley)
"With its black pepper aromas and dry, hard tannins that make the mouth pucker, this is an atypical Rutherford Cabernet. But it's a very good, even a noble one. As tough as it is, it possesses a rich core of black currant that lasts through a long finish. Unusual and distinctive, it should hold its own for a decade.",Riboli 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors. Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years.",Sbragia 2005 Adolsen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley)
"A dark and hearty McLaren Vale Shiraz, with plenty of weight and tannin and concentrated cola, black olive and leather flavors. Hints of mulberry, cedar and vanilla lighten it just enough, but this wine could use another few years before entering its prime drinking window. Finishes long and richly tannic. Drink 2010–2020.",Coriole 2005 Lloyd Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"Better known for its Pinot Noir, Ata Rangi has turned in a fine performance with its 2007 Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassy, but balanced by ripe fig and stone fruit characters that weave an intricately detailed medium-weight palate. Long on the finish. Drink now–2009.",Ata Rangi 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)

"A spicy, dry berry aroma forms a strong opening that's crisp, focused and slightly herbal in character. The palate feels juicy and tight, with crisp tannins that set up racy cassis, plum and mocha flavors. Clean and fresh on the finish.",Santa Helena 2010 Parras Viejas Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This has vigorous tannins and flavors of red cherry pie, red currant and spice. Not a long-term ager, but it offers plenty of upscale pleasure now.",Silverado 2008 Mt George Vineyard Estate Grown Merlot (Napa Valley)
"Half of the wine was fermented with native yeasts, and 30% saw new oak. What shines is the juicy, fresh, delicious fruit—a jumble of raspberries and cherries—plus the finish, which hangs deliciously.",Stoller 2010 JV Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"A pure expression of Nerello Mascalese, this delicate wine opens with aromas of wild berry, smoky spice, crushed stone and tobacco. It shows a dry, dusty finish, with subtle accents of cassis and dried raspberry.",Benanti 2007 Il Monovitigno Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia)

"With rich fruit that is balanced by tight acidity, this shows both the structure and the fragrant red berry flavor of the vintage. The acids cut through the wine to shape its freshness, highlighting its dark tannins. It needs to age for 4–5 years.",Château Pierre de Montignac 2010  Médoc
"An attractively fruity wine, this is rich in cherry and light spice flavors and is laden with acidity. It has a dry set of tannins, but it is so densely juicy that it is ready to drink now.",Clos de Haute-Combe 2011  Juliénas

"Powerful and concentrated, this has a dark red-plum flavor and solid tannins. It is dense, and it shows the structure of the vintage. This is worth aging, and it certainly needs food to show at its best.",Domaine des Nugues 2010  Beaujolais-Villages
"This is the reserve of the Erath lineup and the winery's best effort—along with the Battle Creek bottling—in 2010. Pretty scents and flavors of raspberry and rose water mingle with the ripest cherry fruit in the lineup. Focused, balanced and elegant.",Erath 2010 La Nuit Magique Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

"Distinctive as always, this is another powerful Zinfandel from Martini, which has a long history with this mountain vineyard. The cool 2010 vintage was kind, bringing the wine to its usual high-alcohol superripeness, yet maintaining vital acidity. Notes of raisins, blackberry jam and chocolate are all found in this heady, Porty wine. Drink now with rich barbecue and stews.",Louis M. Martini 2010 Monte Rosso Vineyard Gnarly Vine Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)

"Ripe, concentrated and bullish from the start, this has a roasted berry aroma that leads to a saturated, tannic palate.

Toastiness and a sense of darkness remain on the finish.",Misiones de Rengo 2010 Gran Reserva Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Rapel Valley)
"This is a focused, cool-climate wine, with cherry, raspberry and spice aromas. It's edgy and fresh on the palate, with racy strawberry and cherry flavors that are accented by chocolate and spice notes. The finish is both tangy and zesty as well as spicy and chocolaty. Only 280 cases made.",Kingston Family 2011 Alazan Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"This is a spicy, lively wine with interesting flavors of black cherry cola. It's not a big wine, but it offers a mouthful of pleasure.",Lange 2010 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)

"This is appealing for its flavors of fresh-sliced Bosch pear, plus a pear-like graininess on the palate. It has some residual sugar, just enough to round out the acids, and overall it's a nicely balanced wine drinking very well right now.",Redhawk 2011 Pinot Gris (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Rich and full bodied, this is delicious to drink now for its array of blackberries, currants, dark chocolate and toast flavors. The tannins are just a bit jagged, so give it a few hours in the decanter.",Renteria 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

It shows a direct deliciousness that makes it easy to like.",Trione 2008 Geyserville Ranch Red (Alexander Valley)
"The aromatic opening includes a forest-like note, plus mineral and earthy berry scents. The palate feels chunky and wide, with solid tannins that don't bite or dominate. Flavors of herb, olive, spice, molasses and cassis are typical for the Alto Maipo, while the finish is defined by racy acids that should allow this wine to age nicely for another five-plus years.",Undurraga 2010 T.H. Alto Maipo Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This is a big, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, stuffed with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, red licorice and oak. It's impressive for its sheer volume, with zippy acidity that helps balance the high alcohol. It needs a few hours in the decanter to round off the edges, and it should hold in the bottle for several years.",Aiken 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Mountain)

"Lush, soft and delicious, this has flavors of chocolate, ripe crushed summer blackberries and a hint of dried currants. This richness is augmented by lots of smoky, sweet oak. It could develop in the bottle, but the fruit might fall out before the tannins soften.",Axios 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"Gravel, asphalt and iron drive the minerally nose of this bottling, which also shows cigar box, cherry leather, stewed strawberry and chocolate-caramel aromatics.

"Ripe aromas of prune, cassis and blackberry come with notes of spice cake, minerals and lemon peel. This feels grabby and strong, with pronounced acidity and tannins.

"Here's a smoky, oak-driven wine with a nice balance between spice and aromas that recall blackberry, plum and mature cherry. As the wine evolves in the glass, it exhibits chocolate and espresso bean. It's dense and thick, with firm tannins that give it staying power.",Farnese 2005  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane
"Firriato's blend of Nero d'Avola and Syrah is a youthful wine with aromas of fresh blueberry, plum and prune. The wine offers rich density and very good harmony that makes it both approachable and a pleasure to drink.",Firriato 2005 Santagostino Baglio Sorìa Red (Sicilia)
"Starts out with gritty, granular aromas that hint at raisin, yet the palate is fresher and more stand-up. Flavors of raspberry and cherry are round and sort of earthy, while the tannin-to-acid balance is good. Finishes sort of narrow but with crusty tannins and stature. Drink now.",Valsanzo 2003 Terras Cúa Mencía (Bierzo)
"Classic Weinert wine; meaning it's well-aged, mature and sort of throwback. It's not purple and saturated and sticky; instead it's medium-weight and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry aromas followed by dry cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. A touch of burnt brown sugar offers balance and sweetness, and as a whole it seems ready to drink.",Weinert 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"The opaque eggplant hue of this stunning value promises much—and what's in the glass delivers. Prominent oaky notes are layered over plum and high-toned floral aromas. Dense and voluptuous on the palate, with chewy tannins, this is a seriously ambitious wine that could benefit from a year or two in the bottle.",Yellow Tail 2006 The Reserve Merlot (South Eastern Australia)
"It's toasty and lush with the scents and flavors of roasted walnuts and butterscotch; not a bad thing by any means. Under the sweet oak are flavors of berry, tart and fresh as if just-picked. This is a thoroughly delightful bottle and a rare find at this price—a Pinot Noir that can be enjoyed immediately but should cellar well for up to a decade.",Arcane Cellars 2007 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"More tannic than in past vintages, Bella's '06 Belle Canyon shows the same briary, brambly flavors, with spicy wild berries and olive tapenade accented with fresh green sage, black pepper and rosemary. Drink this exuberant Zin soon, with spicy grilled meats.",Bella 2006 Belle Canyon Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"An herbaceous wine, smoothed out by spicy wood. The wine is balanced, the wood a delicious extra to pear and green plum-skin fruit flavors. Very perfumed, it demands fish with a sauce or scallops.",Château Haut Bertinerie 2006  Premieres Côtes de Blaye
"Emphasizing richness rather than sweetness, here is a wine that is dominated by the dryness of botrytis. It has powerful, dark honey flavors allied to almonds and spice. The fruit, though, is less obvious.",Château Lamothe Guignard 2004  Sauternes
This rich expression of Nerello Mascalese (a grape native to Sicily's Mount Etna) offers thick density and extraction followed by fresh notes of berry fruit and spice. It ends with chewy tannins and bright cherry flavors.,Cottanera 2007 Barbazzale Nerello Mascalese (Sicilia)
"A solid effort, this Shiraz-Viognier blend offers up raspberry and strawberry scents punctuated by more pungent notes of road tar, licorice, cola and black olive. It's full-bodied, powered by its 15% alcohol, yet could use a richer, thicker texture. Drink now to 2011.",Creed of Barossa 2005 Two Brothers Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa)

"Pinot Blanc in a warm year such as 2012 veers closer to the fruitiness of Pinot Gris, as shown here. Barrel fermented in French oak, it remains sleek and crisply defined, with pure fruit flavors of golden apple and ripe pear.",Ken Wright 2012 Pinot Blanc (Willamette Valley)
"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths.",Ken Wright 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Part of King Estate's ambitious Limited Edition program for Pinot Gris, this is packaged in a hock bottle with a label styled for a European look. Slightly off dry, with residual sugar just below one percent, it's lovely with honey, tea, lemon cake and ripe, semitropical fruit flavors. Great focus and balance are in play, with perfect acidity.",King Estate 2011 Limited Edition Blend Pinot Gris (Oregon)
"This five-grape blend is ripe, smooth, loamy and rich on the nose, with aromas of pastry, syrupy berry and cassis. A flush, oaky palate has just enough acidity to maintain its poise, while creamy oak and vanilla flavors shadow mellow black plum and cassis. On the finish, oak hangs around and creates a coffee note. Drink this mouthfilling, friendly and generous wine through 2017.",Koyle 2010 Auma Los Lingues Red (Colchagua Valley)
"The intriguing spice of grapefruit foliage and freshly cut grapefruit peel haunts the aromatic edges of this subtle and rounded but still focused wine. Peppery watercress flares up, too. This delightful wine will perform miracles with food but keep your interest  on its own, too.",Lenikus 2013 Grüner Veltliner (Vienna)
"Big, rich and fruity, this wine has a powerful future. It delivers structure and dense tannins, but it's the generous fruitiness that promises much. The tannins will soften by 2016–2017 to give a ripe, full-bodied wine, packed with fruit.",Terras de Alter 2011 Terra D'Alter Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Crisp and distinctive, with a strong mineral streak, this full-flavored Pinot Blanc has a range of fruit flavors, centered upon apple and pear, but also touching on blood orange and a suggestion of celery as well. Low in alcohol, but high in flavor.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2012 Pinot Blanc (Dundee Hills)
"The deeper shade of rose-petal pink promises intensity that the nose does not fail to deliver. Ripe red cherry fruit is framed by the aromatic lift of nettle leaves. The palate is bone-dry but echoes with that refreshing trinity of nettle, cherry and lemon. A vestige of tannin provides welcome backbone.I",Umathum 2013 Rosa Rosé (Burgenland)
"Spicy, mildly herbal aromas of cassis and red-berry fruits feed into a racy, fresh palate with vital acidity and excellent overall balance. Flavors of spice and berry fruits are persistent, while the finish is deep and feels right. This blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Carmenère is entirely pleasing. Drink through 2018.",Valle Secreto 2011 Private Syrah-Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenere Red (Cachapoal Valley)

Give it until 2015 before drinking to soften the intense acidity.",Vignobles Berthier 2012 Domaine des Clairneaux  (Sancerre)
"This summery Riesling wafts of ripe yellow cherries and blossoms. Dry in style with a rich, rounded mouthfeel, it's deeply concentrated with stone fruit flavors accented by hints of waxy lemon and lime skin.

"Concentrated black-fruit aromas come with notes of rubber, tree bark and rooty berry fruits.

Drink through 2018.",Viña Requingua 2009 Laku Hijo del Sol The Final Blend Red (Curicó Valley)
"Electric purple in color, it conveys wiry aromas of wet dog, green herbs and berry fruits. The palate is loud and clacky, with a jumpy overall feel and an overriding sense of youth. Boysenberry, blueberry and blackberry flavors come with undertones of green herbs and licorice, while the finish is aggressive and moderately complex. Drink through 2019.",Concha y Toro 2011 Terrunyo Entre Cordilleras Peumo Vineyard Block 27 Carmenère (Peumo)

"Ripe and fruity, this is a full-bodied, intense wine. It has citrus acidity as well as more tropical fruits, laden with wood. The whole is much more than the sum of the parts, giving a full, ripe and complex wine that will age.",Fontes da Cunha 2011 Munda Encruzado (Dão)

A juicy element brings fresh black plums and acidity to the mix. The wine is an impressive work in progress. Drink from 2017.",Quinta das Bandeiras 2011 Passagem Reserva Red (Douro)
"Hooray for Shea—a shining star in this difficult vintage. Give it a good sniff and note the wood smoke, cedar and bacon scents rising from the glass.

It's lively and lingering—drink now or cellar until 2024.",Rex Hill 2011 Shea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This mix of Petit Verdot and four other red grapes is dark, slightly raisiny and jammy on the nose. In the mouth, it is ripe and ripped, with depth and density along with soft tannins.

This Pinot Noir can tackle the heartiest beef dish you can make.",Riverbench 2011 Mesa Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)

Crisp acidity keeps it fresh and balanced.",Russiz Superiore 2012 Pinot Grigio (Collio)

"This is a crisp, dry, and very tangy wine blended from Tocai Friulano, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It sizzles with lemon, lime and green-apple flavors. While barrel fermented, it's not obviously oaky and seems to get its energy from high acidity instead. It will be brilliant with simply prepared shellfish, fried chicken or as a palate charger before a meal.",Monte Volpe 2015 Sesso White (Mendocino County)
"Citrus and light herb aromas turn to slightly more buttery, spicy flavors in this medium-bodied well-balanced wine. It has a good sense of richness in the mouthfeel along with hints of vanilla, cream and almond flavors to complement the fruit notes.",Naggiar 2016 Chardonnay (California)

"Cool mint, blueberry and raisin aromas are lush and smooth, but charred oak is roaring loud on the nose of this dry-farmed Syrah. Punchy, short acidity makes the mouthfeel abrupt. Dark chocolate and ripe berry flavors end with hard-spiced blackberry and an everlasting burnt-oak character.",Polkura 2014 Secano Dry Farmed Syrah (Marchigue)

"This bottling is fruit-forward on the nose with aromas of black currant and black plum, but the touches of dark chocolate and roasted game provide depth.

The tannins are present but soft, and the acidity is decent, making for a very drinkable expression.",Clos La Chance 2013 Whitestone Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Central Coast)

"Traces of charred oak in the aroma and a flood of extremely ripe dark-fruit flavors come with a sense of depth and concentration in this full-bodied, very firm and tannic but nevertheless polished wine. This is higher in alcohol than the last two vintages reviewed. It will benefit from more age or a high-protein pairing.",Deaver 2013 Petite Sirah (Amador County)
"This spicy, toasty wine currently shows more wood than fruit. Hints of yellow fruits are already there, so the texture should open to give a riper, fruitier wine. Give it until 2020.",Domaine Françoise André 2015  Savigny-lès-Beaune
"The gold color and buttery flavors give this wine a rich personality for such a low-alcohol level and for a varietal that is often crisp and light. Almost mainstream in style compared to most D&G offerings, it has vanilla, pear and almond to add complexity and a smooth broad texture that soothes the palate.",Donkey & Goat 2016 Clair + Ette Barsotti Vineyard Clairette (El Dorado)
"This blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot and 5% Carmenère is fragrant, with raspberry, freshly sliced bell pepper and green herb notes.

"No-frills berry and cassis aromas open this Cabernet. A wide, jammy palate is generous but a touch off-centered. An aggressive herbal plum flavor leads the charge, while a tannic, grabby finish brings it home.",J. Bouchon 2014 Block Series Reserva Especial Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)
"Dark, briary black-fruit aromas are a little wild but generally well focused. This Syrah displays an iron grip and power throughout. Spicy black-fruit flavors end with toasty oak. Overall, this is dense like an anvil, with a low center of gravity.",Ritual 2014 Alcaparral Syrah (Casablanca Valley)
"Straight down-the-middle aromas of red cherry, salt and pepper, vanilla and a touch of brioche show on this bottling of a clone that's related to the Brunello region.

"Ripe, sun-kissed plum and blackberry flavors are crisply balanced in this juicy, velvet-textured red.

The finish is marked by fine-grained but penetrating tannins.",Suhru 2013 Ember Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"Impressively thick and dark for Joey Tensley's new entry-level brand, this wine's deep and dark aromas of slate-flecked soil makes for a very earthy impression on the nose, along with expected hints of tar, purple flowers and boysenberry. Condensed cassis flavors show on the sip along with hints of lavender and blueberry, laced together by soft tannins and an upright acidity.",Tensley 2015 Syrah (Central Coast)

"The 2015 vintage is a strong one for Woodbridge.

It's a treat to find an inexpensive wine with such good backbone.",Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi 2015 Pinot Noir (California)

It is rich, the yellow fruits cut with some acidity. Drink this full, ripe wine wine from 2019.",Arnaud Baillot 2015 Vielles Vignes Premier Cru  (Montagny)
"This longtime winemaking family uses an old-style label on this bottling of the classic Italian grape, which spent 24 months on American oak.

"This is a serious, tannic wine that has a mineral edge to go with the tight fruit. It is, in fact, ageworthy—for a year or two, with the dry character needs to soften. At the end, the sweet Gamay fruits triumph.",Georges Duboeuf 2008 Séléction  (Saint-Amour)
"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents.

"Big, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla.

Quite good for ten bucks.",Valentin Bianchi 2009 Sensual Malbec (Mendoza)

"A structured, firm wine showing a great balance of red fruits, dry Bordeaux-style tannins and a freshly jammy texture. For a branded Bordeaux, it has both quality and elegance.",Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite) 2005 Réserve Spéciale  (Bordeaux)
"Good wines sometimes come out of the woodwork, such as this Tempranillo rosé from the Granada area. It presents as candy apple, both in color and bouquet. But the palate shows nicely with raspberry and cherry flavors. Gets the job done and stirs some interest. Just 350 cases made.",Dominio Buenavista 2007 Veleta Rosé Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra Contraviesa Alpujarra)
"Deep gold in color, this is a big, dense, rather high-alcohol wine (11.5%) for a kabinett, with honeyed flavors of Golden Delicious apples, dried apricots and candied pineapple. Yet because of the elevated alcohol level, it's not that sweet, finishing on the dry side, with firm acids.",Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2006 Berncasteler Doctor Kabinett Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"A nice, dry, polished Pinot Noir that will drink well with a wide range of foods. It has crisp acids, firm tannins and ripe flavors of herb-infused cherries, raspberries, red currants, cola and spices. Drink now.",Calera 2006 Mt. Harlan Cuvée Pinot Noir (Mount Harlan)
"Berry, dark chocolate and coffee on the nose lead this exuberant red blend from Warwick. Bright fruit flavors and enticing spice on the palate are supported by a solid tannin structure and long finish. Lots of personality and certainly could age, but the wine is approachable now.",Warwick 2005 Estate Reserve Red (Stellenbosch)
"Spicy, bretty and leathery; this type of wine represents Ribera in a traditional, no-tricks light. Air only helps it show its best attributes, which revolve around meaty black fruit and herbal accents. It's chewy, sort of tannic and finishes with flavors of moss and jerky. Good for near-term consumption.",Viña Gormaz 2004 Castillo de Gormaz Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"Always an interesting, exotically offbeat wine, Ballentine's '07 is particularly crisp and savory. It's showing pineapple, green apple, tangerine, fig, vanilla and honey flavors that finish with a clean, dry streak of minerality. Very nice as an alternative to Viognier or Sauvignon Blanc.",Ballentine 2007 Pocai Vineyard Old Vines Chenin Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This is a sort of junior bottling to their world-famous and superexpensive Hillside Select. The 2005 is a very good Cab (with 2% Petite Verdot), but a bit on the soft, sweet, obvious side. Showing pie-filling, almost candied cherry, blackberry, raspberry and chocolate flavors, it resembles many other California Cabernets that don't cost nearly as much.",Shafer 2005 One Point Five Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Released at just a little over a year old, this demonstrates the promise of Lake County for Cabernet. It's a dry, polished and enjoyable wine, with a fine tannin-acid structure and good flavors of blackberries, currants, black cherries and smoky oak.",Shannon Ridge 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lake County)
"Dry and balanced, this blend of Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot has cherry, cassis and smoky oak flavors. It's marked by considerable acidity that gives it a racy sharpness. From Malibu Estate.",Surfrider 2004 Red (Malibu-Newton Canyon)
"Here's a bright young Chardonnay marked by the crisp, tingly acids that you so often find in Edna Valley wines. The fruit is vibrant, offering a burst of Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis and figs, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The alcohol level, by the way, is a relatively low 13.5%.",Kynsi 2006 Edna Ranch Vineyard Chardonnay (Edna Valley)
"This wine nicely displays the fleshy pear, melon and citrus notes of unoaked Chard. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. What it isn't is particularly complex, but it will still go well with any number of seafood or chicken dishes this summer.",Nepenthe 2006 Unoaked Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"Owned by the Bernard family who also own one of the major Bordeaux negociants, Millésima, the wine is structured, deliciously fruity and with a series of smoky tannins that will allow it to age. It comes from a vineyard close to Pauillac and that shows in the dense Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its weight. Drink from 2021.",Château Peyrabon 2014  Haut-Médoc
"An intriguing oak spiciness on both the nose and the palate makes this medium-bodied wine interesting without overpowering the focused and vivid raspberry and red cherry flavors. The wine's texture is lean, braced by fine-grained tannins that give support and balance. Best after 2018.",Clos du Bois 2013 Coro Mendocino Red (Mendocino)
"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020–2030.",D'Arenberg 2013 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)
"This wine opens with the fresh liveliness of stemmy earth and black tea notes, growing funkier and more herbal on the midpalate. Brightly layered and deeply flavored, it's a full-bodied rendition that remains true to its variety.",Davis Bynum 2014 Jane's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This is a vibrant take on the grape, with fresh-pressed boysenberry and wisteria aromas merging with rosemary, fennel and sarsaparilla on the nose. Food friendly, it shows more boysenberry, thyme, white pepper, and floral freshness on the palate.",DeTierra Vineyards 2014 Mesa Del Sol Syrah (Arroyo Seco)
"Spicy musky notes hover above scents of canned peaches. On the palate, these rich peach notes are framed by pleasantly bitter notes of pith and peach skin. The characteristic 2014 freshness makes this bright and sprightly and creates an off-dry finish to the concentrated palate.",Domaine Charles Baur 2014 Pfersigberg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Sweet cedar aromas kick off this attention-grabbing bottling, with elderberry and black plum scents combining for an Old World feel in which the structure can be sensed on sniff alone. Wood and graphite notes pop on the palate, where a loamy riverstone minerality courses through black currant flavors, finishing on chocolate cake.",Rancho Sisquoc 2014 Flood Family Vineyards Merlot (Santa Barbara County)
"Dark in the glass, this blend of 75% Grenache and 25% Syrah is rich and appealing, made in the typical Paso style. Vanilla, cola, spice cake and black cherry aromas lead to a palate laden with milk chocolate, more black cherry, and star anise flavors. The tannins are soft and lush.",Rendarrio Vineyards 2013 First Born King Red (Paso Robles)
"Savory pepper and grilled beef aromas make this wine appetizing, its rich berry and ripe plum flavors bringing excellent concentration and depth to the palate. It's big and bold, yet polished. Firm tannins interlacing with ripeness and spiciness to keep it balanced and help propel a lingering finish.",Seven Deadly Zins 2014 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)
"This opens with dry underbrush, sun-baked soil and French oak aromas. The palate is equally brooding, its dried black cherry and blackberry fruit brushed with licorice and espresso flavors. Assertive, close-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Drink 2020–2027.",Siro Pacenti 2012 Pelagrilli  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"A pretty soft-focus wine, this opens gracefully with cherry lollipop fruit, accented with chocolate-coated orange peel. It's smooth, almost silky, showing just a hint of the granitic minerality that typifies this AVA. The wine spent 10 months in 42% new oak.",Sokol Blosser 2014 Hyland Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"Star anise, forest floor, mature dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of menthol perfume this structured red. The taut, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and pipe tobacco flavors, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2027.",Tenute Silvio Nardi 2012 Manachiara  (Brunello di Montalcino)
"Made entirely from Sangiovese, this elegant Chianti has enticing ripe red berry, violet and baking spice scents. The palate doles out succulent black cherry, leather and clove notes, while firm, savory tannins offer support. Enjoy through 2021.",Tolaini 2013 Montebello Sette Gran Selezione  (Chianti Classico)
"Tightly structured in a ripe, bold bundle of cherry and berry flavors, this is an intensely tannic and youthful wine, clearly indicative of the vintage. Sage, dried herb, marshmallow and toasted oak aromas round it out, giving it flavor beyond its innate concentration.",Vine Cliff 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville)
"On the nose, luscious peach notes are slightly muddied by earthier notes. On the palate, generous sweetness boosts all the fruit flavors to an intense lusciousness. There is balance in the form of lemony freshness and a lovely tangy texture. This is momentarily quite intense.",Joseph Cattin 2015 Hatschbourg Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Light and earthy, this wine glows in spicy citrus, with a rhubarb-and-strawberry tartness and black tea accents. Medium-bodied, it shows an underlying crispness that belies its weight and depth, the oak subtle yet supportive.",K Squared Cellars 2014 Ketcham Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This doesn't appear to be the strongest recent vintage of this wine, but it remains a benchmark for McLaren Vale Shiraz. Hints of vanilla and tobacco leaf add nuance to a mix of berries ranging from red raspberry to black currant, but there's also a hint of bruised fruit and a green toughness to the tannins. Give it some time in the cellar. Drink 2020–2030.",Kay Brothers 2014 Amery Vineyard Block 6 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)
"This Chardonnay from Dan Kessler and Ellen Haak-Kessler is a blend of of clones 95 and 76, featuring tangerine, pear, and chamomile on the nose. The palate is framed by tension and bright acidity, opening up to riper flavors of peach and melon, with a hint of sea salt.",Kessler-Haak 2015 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Made from 79% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 8% Cabernet Franc, this wine shows a rich, full-bodied and juicy core of soft, baked plum, cherry and vanilla flavors, with a lingering streak of cinnamon. Not a vineyard designate, this is rather a selection of complementary wine lots and barrels.",Kuleto Estate 2012 Lone Acre Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Earthy in anise and blue fruit, this wine is inexplicably crisp and plush at the same time, showing the allure of the variety in its rose petal aromas. Medium bodied and velvety, it follows through in cassis and pomegranate flavors.",MacRostie 2014 Wildcat Mountain Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Its prime location near Archery Summit and Domaine Drouhin marks Nysa as one of Oregon's most sought-after fruit sources. Mark McNeilly (of Mark Ryan Winery) has chosen it for one of two vineyard designates for this new project. Sweet baking spices and raspberry jam are the hallmarks here, offering immediate appeal, while retaining the structure to age for another decade. Aim for an optimal drinking window from 2019 through 2024.",Megan Anne 2014 Nysa Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"This captures all the ripe fruit and fresh mouthfeel you could ask for in a young Riesling. Succulent and peachy, with references to other mixed tree fruits, this also brings highlights of orange pekoe tea. Residual sugar is 20 g/L.",Melrose 2015 Riesling (Umpqua Valley)
"Light in color, this bottling from a famous vineyard shows red cherry, crushed clove and woody herb notes on a nose that's both sanguine and sharp with anise spice. The palate is lively and spicy, with energetic white sage and bright red fruit leading into a long-lasting, menthol-laced finish.",Miner 2014 Garys' Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and center—a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries. There's a certain stiffness to the tannins still, but overall it's finely proportioned and should be enjoyable through the mid-2020s.",Owen Roe 2014 Sojourner Vineyard Pommard Clone Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills)
"Underbrush, oak, wild berry, herb and balsamic notes lead the nose of this Brunello. Tightly wound, fine-grained tannins frame cranberry, red cherry, orange zest and white pepper flavors on the palate. A hint of star anise signals the close. Drink 2020–2027.",Podere Brizio 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
Apple notes have a lifted ethereal quality. The palate comes in with beautifully poised lemon freshness that counters the just off-dry richness of the fruit flavors. This is balm-like in its apple-focused fruitiness and goes down very easily. Flavors linger.,Dopff & Irion 2011 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Nutty and lush with layers of peach, pear and lime fruit, this is a medium-bodied and well-balanced white. It's refreshing while offering both length and breadth on the palate.",Eric Kent 2015 Cuvée Renee Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County)
"Rich, ripe and oaky, this full-bodied wine has loads of sweet blackberry and black cherry flavors, with generous doses of oak spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, wood smoke and dark chocolate. It's bold but complex and will be a lot of fun to drink with red meat.",Freakshow 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This wine is lifted by vibrant acidity and shows bread-like aromas accented with wild strawberry, compost and forest floor flavors. Light-bodied and fresh on the palate, it's nicely crafted and table-ready.",Gloria Ferrer 2013 Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Fiesta is the lightest, most fruit forward of the four different Tempranillos from Abacela. In a great year such as this, it's also substantial and authoritative, with deeply driven flavors of red and blueberry fruit, a whiff of oak and slightly grainy tannins. This wine clearly over-delivers for the price.",Abacela 2014 Fiesta Tempranillo (Umpqua Valley)
"Apricot, fig and fresh-cut grass intertwine on the nose of this pungently crisp white, lengthy in honeydew melon. Light bodied and lightly textured, it offers a burst of acidity on the finish.",Hanna 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)
"Strong gravel, slate and other rocky mineral elements show on the nose of this wine, which also boasts black-cherry compote aromas. The palate is also earth-driven, with wet clay and flint flavors holding throughout the sip. It's distinctive if only on one strong note.",Robert Hall 2013 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Barbecue smoke is prevalent both on the nose and palate, a characteristic that lays atop supple tannins and oak. This wine has a powerful bite of bitterness on the lean, herbal finish.",Rutherford Ranch 2012 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Aromas of lime and tropical fruits are clean and lean. This is lifted by citric acidity and spritz, while flavors of lime, green herbs and bell pepper are authentic. Beyond that, there's not much to this besides overriding freshness.",Santa Ema 2015 Select Terroir Sauvignon Blanc (Maipo Valley)
"Saucy, herbal berry aromas come with gritty notes of earth and rubber. This feels chunky and grabby, with drawing tannins. Flavors of black plum, clove, green herbs and coffee grinds finish with a noticeable herbal boost.",Siegel 2014 Über Cuvée Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"An ode to the founding fathers, this bottling is quite tight on the nose, with lime skin, lime blossom and Meyer-lemon juice aromas. The palate offers apple skins, crisp apple flesh, lemon-tinged butter, grapefruit zest and a shaving of vanilla.",The Federalist 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County)
"The nose isn't very expressive but eventually reveals leather and berry. The easygoing palate shows fruity notes of wild cherry, raspberry and a hint of kitchen spice. It's simple and fresh so enjoy soon.",Trerose 2014 Salterio  (Rosso di Montepulciano)
"Still young, this wine has considerable acidity that is surprising. Its cherry fruits are fresh with soft tannins and a juicy aftertaste. It needs another six months to calm down. Drink from summer 2016.",Vignerons de Bel Air 2014 Les Crêtes  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"Aromas of tilled earth, truffle and woodland berry lead the nose. The lively, straightforward palate offers up juicy wild cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside soft, polished tannins. Simple but well made, it's ideal for everyday.",Villa Calcinaia 2013 Piegaia  (Chianti Classico)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, Canaiolo, Mammolo, Colorino and Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of espresso, scorched earth and ripe berry. The firm, rather evolved palate offers dried black cherry and clove alongside moderate acidity and drying tannins.",Villa S. Anna 2012  Rosso di Montepulciano
"The Comté Tolosan PDI covers vines throughout the southwest wine region. This Malbec is a ripe, structured wine that is rich with ripe black fruit flavors. It has an edge of minerality as well as juicy berry fruits and generous tannins. The wine is ready to drink.",Vinovalie 2014 Tarani Malbec
"Velvety texture underlies dusty tannins and neutral oak in this light and lean wine from a vineyard in the heart of Pinot Noir country. Vanilla and cherry play off each other nicely, finding equal partnership with a buoyant acidity.",Wait Cellars 2014 Los Amigos Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Russian River Valley)
"Sweet-leaning red berries meet with touches of cinnamon and vanilla on the nose of this affordably priced wine. There is decent acidic zest on the palate, which frames the tart cranberry and dark strawberry fruit and is leveled by pencil-lead flavors. It's fairly simplistic overall.",Crespi Ranch 2013 Mission Series Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"This is a ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc wine. It has hints of Mediterranean tropical fruits as well as the more familiar cool climate herbal flavors. It is young, probably too young to drink now, so wait until early 2017.",Domaine D'en Ségur 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Côtes du Tarn)
"An immediately attractive wine that is bursting with black currant fruitiness. Along with light tannins and red berry fruits, it is fresh without any hint of wood aging. The wine is ready to drink.",Domaine du Théron 2014 Malbec (Cahors)
"Boysenberry, violets and a touch of bacon fat show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard on Paso's Eastside. The palate is upright in both tannins and searing acidity, with flavors of tart blueberry and black peppercorn.",Eberle 2013 Steinbeck Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles)
"With a dull nose not making any promises, this wine turns out to be a velvety, full-bodied explosion of packed dark-cherry flavor and cola-vanilla, with moderate acidity and structure.",Ektimo Vineyards 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Pear blossom, baked lemons, packed lemon flowers, apple juice, walnut and a touch of quinine pop on the nose of this wine from a challenging grape. The palate is rich but zesty with walnut oil, chamomile, lime, apple and pear notes, offering lots of textural intrigue.",Epiphany 2014 Camp Four Vineyard Roussanne (Santa Barbara County)
"With soft tannins and ripe berry fruits, this is an immediately accessible wine. It has a fresh character, with a smoky edge and a ripe, smooth aftertaste. This would make a great barbecue wine for the summer.",Aveleda 2014 Charamba Red (Douro)
"Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this offers subtle aromas of violet and damp underbrush. The palate is rather simple, offering red cherry and a leather note. Drink soon.",Canneto 2014  Rosso di Montepulciano
"Made mostly with Sangiovese and topped up with a small amount of Canaiolo and Malvasia Nera, this offers aromas that recall red berry, dark spice, menthol and a whiff of moist earth. The easygoing, tangy palate offers wild cherry, orange zest and a hint of clove alongside zesty acidity. Enjoy through 2016.",Casa Emma 2013  Chianti Classico
"A ripe, soft wine that has touches of wood from its four months aging in barrel. There is a spicy, perfumed character with apricot and ripe pear flavors. The acidity is well in balance. Drink this attractive wine now.",Casa Ermelinda Freitas 2014 Terras do Pó Chardonnay-Viognier (Península de Setúbal)
"This characteristic blend of Braucol, Duras, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is light, soft and fruity with red berry flavors. It is ready to drink with its rounded, smooth aftertaste. Braucol is the local patois name for Fer Servadou.",Château Lastours 2012 Red (Gaillac)
"This wine is slightly austere at the start, despite its fuller body and style. Leathery and dusty in tannin, the black and blue fruit remain elusive, teasing in between bouts of coffee and chocolate.",Chelsea Goldschmidt 2013 Merlot (Dry Creek Valley)
"This is a light, clear and candied wine, somewhat thin, that's also tangy in acidity. Also holding 5% Zinfandel and 5% Sangiovese, it's definitely fruity in cherry and vanilla without getting overripe, a good value made by longtime winemaker Dr. Richard Peterson.",Crespi Ranch 2012 Mission Series Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"This easygoing wine falls into the soft side, bordering on a soapy mouthfeel. Flavors of banana-cream and coconut-cream pie abound, with 30% new oak making its impact felt. The finish is yeasty. This is best enjoyed well chilled.",Deer Creek 2014 Chardonnay (Rogue Valley)
"In keeping with the good quality of 2015's Beaujolais Nouveau, this is a ripe red fruit and black cherry flavored wine. It has really fresh, juicy acidity and the softest tannins. It's a bright, fruity wine that is just waiting to drink.",Domaine de la Madone 2015 Nouveau  (Beaujolais-Villages)
"This intensely fresh wine is a blend of Duras, Braucol and Syrah in a textured, stalky style that is tight and layered with tannins. It's certainly young, still bursting with fruit and needing to fill out as its tannins soften and its black currant fruit calms down. Then it will be a fascinating, complex wine, elegant and poised. Drink from 2018.",Domaine des Terrisses 2015 Doux Mauzac (Gaillac)
"Dusty dried herb notes lend a savory tone to this dry Riesling. Straightforward but brisk, it offers abundant lime acidity off set by fresh apple and pear flavors. Drink now.",Dr. Bürklin-Wolf 2014 Estate Dry Riesling (Pfalz)
"Aged in both French and American oak, just 30% of it new, this dark wine is somewhat thin, despite its full body and high level of ripeness. It mixes aromas and flavors of sage, plum and raspberry chocolate.",Ektimo Vineyards 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Russian River Valley)
"This blend of Grenache, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre is fighting (and winning) above its weight (price) class. Tarry, gritty, asphalt-like aromas blend with smoky berry notes to form an inviting bouquet. The palate is round and juicy in feel, with herbal, minty red-berry flavors and a deep, flush finish that's showing a high level of complexity. Drink through 2018.",Bodega Volcanes de Chile 2011 Tectonia Red (Central Valley)

The flavors are dominated by purple fruits, trending toward blackberry and blueberry, with violet florals and rustic dust.",Bonny Doon 2010 Le Cigare Volant Reserve Red (Central Coast)
"Aromas of graphite, earthy berry, dried cheese, fine oak and dense black fruits make for a supremely confident bouquet. The palate on this Cabernet-led blend is pure, forward and racy, with depth and structure. Flavors of coconutty oak blend with chocolate, blackberry and cassis, while the finish is ripe, long and satisfying, with just a touch of herbal essence. Drink through 2019.",Caliterra 2011 Edicion Limitada Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Made by a small estate that's one of Montalcino's little-known gems, this delicious and earthy. It weaves together sensations of ripe red cherry, black raspberry, leather, blue flower, sweet cake spices and a hint of orange zest. The juicy fruit is balanced by friendly, velvety tannins. Enjoy now–2019.",Il Paradiso di Manfredi 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"All of LVV's 2011 Saint-Joseph's are impressive. This one is fuller bodied and more lushly textured than the others while still showing intense Syrah character. Blueberry fruit and hickory smoke mark the nose, while the palate reveals remarkable nuances of crushed stone yet ends long and velvety. Drink now–2020.",Les Vins de Vienne 2011 L'Arzelle  (Saint-Joseph)
"Powerful blackberry, prune, juniper, cola and fern aromas are demanding but appealing for Spanish Cabernet. This feels tannic, full and generous, with flavors of spicy, lightly green berry fruits. A foresty note accents an elegant yet strong finish. Drink through 2022.",Marques de Griñon 2010 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon (Dominio de Valdepusa)
"This Maule Valley old-vines Carignan opens with licorice, blackberry and cassis aromas along with exotic spice notes. It's big, tannic and firm as a boulder, with baked flavors of black fruits blended with coffee and toast. Licorice, blackened toast and overall grit take this to a good but gripping conclusion. Drink through 2018.",Morandé 2010 Edición Limitada Carignan (Loncomilla Valley)
"Talk about an assertive flavor profile, this smells vividly like black pepper and black cherries, then adds smoky accents on the palate. Firm-textured and medium-bodied, it is made from one of the Rhône Valley's wildest-tasting grapes and is unconventional, unadulterated and unusually satisfying.",Sol Rouge 2011 Estate Mourvèdre (Red Hills Lake County)
"This puff-pastry of a wine has a vivid gold color, enticing bread-dough aromas and lush texture. Ripe peach and honey flavors are layered with butterscotch and mineral notes that lead to a lingering finish. Full-boded, well-balanced and delightful.",Sol Rouge 2012 Viognier (Lake County)
"A bit of moody musk precedes notes of lifted orange marmalade—bitter-sweet peel countered by juicy lusciousness. The botrytis is palpable here amongst the concentrated sweetness, so wonderfully shot through with lemony acid. A focused, refreshing BA, with swirls of citrus that go on and on.",Salomon-Undhof 2009 Noble Rot Beerenauslese Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"From Olsen vineyard grapes, this is brawny, ripe, dark and oaky—what else would you expect? It's a take-no-prisoners red that is loaded with spicy blackberry fruit. Tannins are ripe and in proportion, and the fruit has that notable lift from vivid acidity that sets Washington reds apart.",Sparkman 2012 Ring of Fire Petite Sirah (Yakima Valley)
"This solid and dense wine has firm tannins as well as juicy fruitiness. It is dark, rich and full of black fruits that are cut with intense acidity. It needs to age further, so drink from 2015.",Château de Bellevue 2011 Les Charmes  (Morgon)
"A blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre and Petite Sirah all aged in neutral oak, it's jazzy and appealing with notes of blue fruit, raspberry, smoked meat and peppery spices showing good purity and richness. It's nowhere near as weighty as the labeled alcohol level might suggest.",Dusted Valley 2012 Squirrel Tooth Alice Red (Wahluke Slope)
"This opens with an intense fragrance of perfumed berries, crushed blue flower, hints of Mediterranean herbs and a whiff of new leather. The ripe palate brings together juicy wild cherry layered with notes of baking spices alongside supple tannins and just enough freshness. Enjoy now–2017.",Gianni Brunelli 2012  Rosso di Montalcino
"You can't compare Borobo to anything else because what else is a blend of Carmenère, Cab Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir? Overall, this is a polished wine with tobacco, balsam wood and cedary berry aromas. The palate is soft and rich, with mellow tannins. Flavors of spice, berry and plum are slightly baked, and the finish keeps the mellow, fruity vibe going. Drink through 2018.",Lapostolle 2010 Borobo Red (Rapel Valley)

"This is the most impressive Chante-Alouette I can recall, boasting layers of honeyed pineapple fruit, the barest hint of fresh, just-golden toastiness and notes of gingered apricot. It's full bodied and lush on the palate, ending long and mouthwatering. It should drink well into 2015, but expect it to close up only to re-emerge between 2020 and 2030.",M. Chapoutier 2011 Chante-Alouette Marsanne (Hermitage)
"Bright, zesty lemon appears alongside yellow Mirabell plum that also pervades the palate. There is linear focus, as befits an icewine made from Riesling—and if you have desserts that feature confit lemon, this is what you need. Incredible that something so rich should be so wonderfully light at the same time.",Markus Huber 2013 Eiswein Riesling (Niederösterreich)
"Sultry notions of honeycomb, pine sap and something more tropical—perhaps pineapple, perhaps passion fruit—converge in an incredibly concentrated and at the same time tight and light-footed palate. Passion fruit notes intensify on the palate and while this is very sweet, racy, zesty acidity holds wonderful sway. This expresses the much-lauded purity of Eiswein perfectly.",Nigl 2012 Eiswein Grüner Veltliner (Niederösterreich)
"This elegant Nebbiolo delivers the grape's classic sensations of crushed raspberry, dark cherry, violet, sweet cake spices and a hint of orange peel. It's juicy and fresh with supple tannins. While this can age for a couple more years, enjoy it now for maximum freshness.",Paolo Scavino 2012 Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"Ridge's historic Monte Bello estate produces black tobacco, wet slate, chalk and blueberry jam aromas in this vintage. The wine, which gets support from 14% Merlot-3% Petite Verdot-1% Cabernet Franc, is not very dense and even racy on the palate, with violet, cola, tart cranberry and darker fruit as well.",Ridge 2011 Monte Bello Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Adam Lee's take on this vineyard on the eastern border of the Sta. Rita Hills is rich with tomato, cinnamon, sour cherry and tart blackberry aromas.

Rita Hills)
"Brisk freshness characterizes this Pinot from Richard Sanford, a pioneer in the region. The wine presents violet and elderberry on the nose and is soft yet extra-expressive once sipped, with mocha, strawberry, black tea, and, on the edges, a grapefruit peel bitterness.",Alma Rosa 2012 La Encantada Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"There's a bit more fruit—cherry, cranberry—and no dust to this Cigare compared to other Bonny Doon bottlings, but blacker aromas of asphalt and char persist. The blend of 36% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 20% Mourvèdre and 19% Cinsault delivers strong tannins and flavors of a black-and-blue filet mignon topped with a wild berry reduction sauce",Bonny Doon 2009 Le Cigare Volant Red (Central Coast)
"Charred meat, blood, concrete and elderberry form a deep and complex nose. The fine-grained tannins deliver gamy, blackberry flavors, making for a very solid wine that's a steal of a deal.",Vina Robles 2011 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
"This Pinot Noir project from the Napa Valley's Hall family starts with dense and inky core aromas of ripe raspberry and black tea, with a touch of vanilla. Once sipped, the flavors verge toward black cherry and blackberry, with very liqueur-like chocolate and a pronounced and lasting spice element.",Walt 2012 Rita's Crown Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"On the nose, layers range from fragrant and floral jasmine to mango sorbet, and ripe nectarine to oven-fresh croissants. The mouthfeel is creamy, with stone fruit and banana flavors. Zingy acidity powers a long finish.",Windstream 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018.",Pagos del Rey 2011 Gran Bajoz  (Toro)
"Montepulciano, Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes team up to produce this firmly structured but accessible red. The palate delivers ripe black cherry, red currants and tobacco lightly accented with oak-driven spice. It's balanced with firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2016.",PoderNuovo a Palazzone 2011 Therra Red (Toscana)
"Structured and firm, this is a dry wine with the potential of fine fruit in the future. Acidity cuts through the texture promising the freshness of black currants and berries. It's a perfumed wine that can still age. Drink from 2016.",Quinta das Carvalhas 2012 Touriga Nacional (Douro)
"Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids. Holding until 2016–2017 may help to smooth it out, but it's perfectly delightful already.",Soléna 2013 Grande Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Sweet-seeming aromas and flavors dominate this full-bodied, ripe-tasting wine—not unusual for a Rhône-style blend that leads with  Grenache. A spicy, smoky influence is delicious in its own right, but has a tasty component of fresh blackberry and boysenberry to back it up.",The Dancing Fox 2011 Côtes du Renard Red (Lodi)
"Slightly oxidized aromas of marzipan, pressed yellow flowers, dried lemon rinds and apricot cream entice the nose on this wine from the historic vineyard by Joshua Klapper. The palate shows woody spice and a unique iodine character, with cinnamon, salt, sour yeastiness and a touch of tart citrus peel.",La Fenêtre 2011 Bien Nacido Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Pure Syrah, this is young, spicy and crisp, with blue plum, red licorice and a streak of dark chocolate. It has a light suggestion of the gamy, cured meat character that typifies Syrah. This marks a good start for such young (second leaf) vines.",Ledger David 2011 Syrah (Rogue Valley)
"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip.",Ledger David 2012 Sangiovese (Rogue Valley)
"Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, spice, underbrush and dried herbs emerge from this blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. The palate delivers dried black cherries, plum, clove and grilled sage alongside tightly-knit tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",Leopoldo I di Toscana 2011 D'Aria Red (Toscana)
"Remarkably strong cinnamon characterizes the nose of this old-vine wine, which also shows red and black cherries, potpourri and gingerbread on the nose. Black raspberries, cranberry-pomegranate juice, dark chocolate, purple flowers, black pepper and cardamom entertain the palate, which also offers decent acidity and grip, but finishes quickly.",Lone Madrone 2012 Martinelli Zinfandel (Paso Robles)
"Dense aromas of earth, berry fruits, latex and animal fur are a touch challenging at first but balance out with airing. This has a crisp, fresh feel despite coming from a hot year. Lightly herbal, leathery flavors of red currant and wild berry finish oaky, with more than adequate filling.",Maquis 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"This blend is mostly Syrah, with Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon backing it up. Dense, earthy, meaty and lightly roasted on the nose, the palate is mildly tannic, with lively acidity. Roasted, foresty plum and red-berry flavors end short and baked in character.",Maray 2010 Red (Limarí Valley)
"This Sangiovese opens with aromas of blue flowers, underbrush, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of roasted coffee beans, all of which carry over to the concentrated palate along with black pepper and clove. The tannins are still tightly wound but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness.",Marchesi de' Frescobaldi 2011 Montesodi Sangiovese (Toscana)
"Vibrant and elegant, this delivers aromas and flavors of crushed red cherry, raspberry, cinnamon-spice and Alpine herbs. Supple tannins and bright acidity provide support. Enjoy through 2018.",Nino Negri 2010 Inferno  (Valtellina Superiore)
"Elegant and fragrant, this blend of 90% Nebbiolo and 10% Merlot from Valtellina opens with aromas of violet, rose, wild berry and cake spice. The vibrant, luminous palate doles out juicy red cherries, crushed raspberries and cinnamon, framed in bright acidity and supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",Nino Negri 2010 Quadrio  (Valtellina Superiore)
"Aromas of toast, blue flowers, sage and mineral lead the nose. The bright palate offers red berry, clove, orange rind and roasted coffee beans alongside firm acidity and assertive tannins. Drink through 2020.",Nino Negri 2010 Sassella Le Tense  (Valtellina Superiore)
"Aromas of vanilla, oak, white flower, hay and pear lead the nose of this blend of 30% Sauvignon, 30% Chardonnay, 30% Incrocio Manzoni and 10% Nebbiolo. The unusual palate offers citrus, Alpine herbs, dried apple, candied lemon, a hint of tropical fruit and a coffee note that lingers on the close. The rich flavors are brightened by racy acidity.",Nino Negri 2013 Ca' Brione White (Terrazze Retiche di Sondrio)
"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now–2017.",Ogier 2013 Héritages Elevé en Foudres de Chêne Red (Côtes du Rhône)
"Tart white peach and plum notes are fresh and fragrant throughout this crisp, mineral-driven Chardonnay. It's satisfyingly plump in mouthfeel, yet vivacious and crisp on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",Pflüger 2013 Quarzit Chardonnay (Pfalz)
"This densely extracted expression of Pinot Nero opens with aromas of tilled soil, espresso, toasted oak and sage. The concentrated palate delivers blackberry extract, coffee, vanilla, chocolate and a hint of herb alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins.",Podere Monastero 2013 La Pineta Pinot Nero (Toscana)
"Made from Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this structured red offers aromas of black currant, toast, graphite and a whiff of cedar. The firm palate offers coconut, coffee, grilled sage and red berry alongside bracing tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit richness.",Poggio Mandorlo 2008 Red (Toscana)
"Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength. It is moderately tannic, while the texture is mouthfilling and the finish rather warm.",Prospect 772 2012 The Truant G-S-M (Sierra Foothills)
"This fruity, friendly Pinot opens with ripe berry aromas mixed with touches of minerality and latex. It feels fresh and sturdy, with black cherry and raspberry flavors. A pure, sweet, lightly chocolaty finish wraps things up.",Ritual 2014 Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Smoke, cedar and plum aromas are followed by a focused palate of pepper and berry flavors. Poised and sophisticated, this wine is great for fans of drier style reds.",Semeli 2004 Grande Reserve Agiorgitiko (Nemea)
"Firm and spicy, this blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of black plum, crushed violet and kitchen spices. The juicy palate delivers ripe black cherry, licorice and clove alongside a backbone of tightly wound but refined tannins. Drink 2016–2020.",Tenuta Sette Ponti 2012 Crognolo Red (Toscana)
"This brooding wine opens with aromas of mature blue and black fruit, allspice, charred earth and whiff of game. The palate delivers spiced blueberry, blackberry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside assertive tannins.",Terre del Marchesato 2011 Il Tarabuso Cabernet Sauvignon (Toscana)
"Dark-colored and deeply flavored, this full-bodied wine smells smoky and meaty, tastes savory, feels firm and appropriately tannic. Showing the more robust, hearty side of Pinot, it can be paired successfully with most opulent meat and fowl dishes.",Tom Eddy 2012 Manchester Ridge Pinot Noir (Mendocino County)
"Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018.",Vega Escal 2011 Red (Priorat)
"Brambly cassis and raspberry aromas are warm and a touch cooked. This is bullish, heavy and grabby in feel, with big tannins. Blackberry, cassis, herb and chocolate flavors finish ripe and dark. Drink through 2017.",Viu Manent 2012 La Capilla Single Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Colchagua Valley)
"Aside from hints of dark wild raspberries, this entry-level, second-label wine by Norm Yost doesn't offer overt fruit on the nose, instead showing graphite, dark earth and crushed rocks. Earthy flavors of beet juice and juniper show a slightly sour side, making for an interesting wine, if not completely delicious",YNOT 2013 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"The vineyard has been source to several wineries including Conn Creek, who had a successful 2002, but this '04 is a let-down. Despite some decent black currant and oak flavors the wine feels tannicly sharp and astringent, without charming softness, and does not seem capable of improving in the cellar.",Conn Creek 2004 Hozhoni Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"A subtle nose of smoke and spice leads into flavors of smoke, slightly tart berry and spice on this affordable South African Merlot. Smooth tannins and a soft finish give the wine an everyday, food-friendly feel.",KWV 2004 Merlot (Western Cape)
"Tropical fruit and banana on the nose and palate are both exotic and unusual in this affordable Sauvignon Blanc, and a lively acidity adds to the appeal. A refreshing and fun everyday wine, pair this with ethnic food or salads.",Thorntree 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)
"Lively and balanced, this wine offers fresh fruit flavors and an undertone of minerality. A classic but uncomplicated white with a dry character that will pair well with fresh seafood—think ceviche—or Thai food.",Indaba 2007 Chenin Blanc (Western Cape)
"With alcohol at an astounding 16.5%, this Zin tastes hot and peppery. Some high alcohol wines have a fat sweetness that makes them delicious. This one's bone dry, with dried blackberry and cherry flavors that finish with a burn.",Mazzocco 2005 Reserve West Dry Creek Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Lots of leather and churned earth on the nose, and with time plum and tomato notes enter the party. It's a forward, aggressive Tempranillo with jumpy red-fruit flavors and a long, angular finish. Not really a wine for connoisseurs, but good for everyday consumption.",Valsanzo 2006 Damalisco  (Toro)
"Dry and leafy in the Cru Bourgeois sense of Bordeaux. And that makes sense given that it's Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Tempranillo from a cool, tough vintage. While not vegetal, the wine is herbal and nervous, with leafy notes and burnt brown sugar flavors.",Castillo de Monjardin 2002 Crianza Red (Navarra)
"A strange bird for sure. The blend is 70% Chardonnay, 20% Sauvignon Blanc and 10% Picapoll. In no way is it common, and truth be told it lags far behind the winery's usually excellent reds. But it does have a lot of kick, body and tropical fruit. And for a unique Spanish white, it may draw some interest because it's not poorly made.",Masies d'Avinyo 2007 Abadal Blanc White (Pla de Bages)
"Big and sweet, with ripe berry aromas, candy and leather on the nose. This wine is a classic fruity joven; it's bulky and easygoing, with black cherry, raspberry and chocolate. If you aren't looking for miracles, this is fine within the young Ribera del Duero category.",Arroyo 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)
"Rusty in color with a neutral, light-styled nose. This wine shows all of its age via lean apple skin and cherry flavors. It's a bit acidic and stripped down, but deep inside there's adequate tobacco, leather and coffee notes.",Viña Albali 1999 Gran Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepeñas)
"For an affordable, everyday red, this is a pretty good investment. It's dry and full-bodied, with berry, earth, mocha and spice flavors.",Grayson 2006 Merlot (Paso Robles)
"Osborne is now in Ribera del Duero, and if this wine is an indication of what to expect, then work needs to be done. It has a cheesey nose with no real fruit character. The palate has acidic freshness but also a dearth of substance and a grabby feel. It's not bad wine per se, but in RDD the competition is stiff and this isn't going to draw many converts.",Osborne Selección 2003 Señorio del Cid Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)
"This wine offers clean, minerally aromas and a palate of honey and apples. Pair with poultry or fresh seafood. Not overly elegant, but a good wine from a great producer.",Slowine 2007 Chenin Blanc - Sauvignon Blanc White (Overberg)
"Fairly rough and gaseous at first (and we tried two different samples), although it does soften with time. The mouth and palate are pretty good: Raspberry and plum flavors are tasty, and the acidity is not lacking. Finishes with earth and a touch of burnt coffee.",Condesa de Leganza 2003 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"Marked by simple pineapple and citrus flavors, this plump, fleshy-textured Chard turns unexpectedly crisp and slighly metallic on the finish.",Schild Estate 2007 Unwooded Chardonnay (Barossa)
"Powerful in pungent gooseberry flavors, this wine will appeal to aficionados of New Zealand Sauvignons, but will leave those craving riper, lusher fruit flavors out in the cold. The acidity is very high, almost making the wine what the French call pétillant, or fizzy.",St. Supéry 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"This is the least successful Judd's Hill Cabernet in recent memory. The current '04 bottling is lean, with cherry tea and mint flavors. A disappointment.",Judd's Hill 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Carneros isn't ideal for Cabernet, as it's too cool. Even in this hot vintage, Truchard's '04 bottling has an unripe, vegetal streak beside the cassis, chocolate and new oak flavors.",Truchard 2004 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Carneros)
"Everyone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour. There isn't much middle or body to it, so expect scratchy red fruit and lots of wayward acidity.",Pago de los Capellanes 2002 Tinto Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"Young, rambunctious Toro is what this is. It's leathery and raw on the nose, with barrel char to boot. The palate is sweet, unctuous and creamy, with candied berry flavors and caramel. And the tannins are typically huge and grabby.",Estancia Piedra 2006 Azul  (Toro)
"Vibrant to the point of spritzy, with more tartness than cushion. This is a sharp rendition of Viura that emphasizes grapefruit and lemon. It stretches astringency to its limit, and yet some may like it because it will never be confused for plodding.",Osborne 2006 Solaz Blanco Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Shows some rather lactic overtones to go with ample citrus and guava flavors. Medium-bodied, with a fresh, lemony finish.",Marquee 2006 Signature Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)
"Overly ripe and sugary sweet, this Merlot, with a splash of Cab, has a rustic feeling. There is ripe fruit and fine tannins, but the sweetness is a problem.",Donati 2005 Merlot (Paicines)
"This is a 100% estate wine from the producer's cool-climate sites near the town of Freestone. Black pepper and a nutty entry invite one in to explore further, this wine having many stories to tell as it develops. Soft and mellow, it's also feral and funky, with a strong essence of mushroomy forest floor.",Joseph Phelps 2013 Quarter Moon Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a beautiful and beguiling wine, so different from many of its counterparts in its sizzling, citrus-driven acidity and persistent freshness. Tangerine and grapefruit are the stars, unexpectedly keeping this light-bodied vineyard-designate alive and inviting on the palate.",Brick & Mortar 2014 Sweetwater Springs Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The top rosé from old vines at Grand Boise, this is a ripe, well-structured and balanced wine. The fruit is right up front, raspberries and red plums along with a lightly herbal element. The high-altitude vineyard (up to 2,000 feet) gives a cool, crisp aftertaste to this impressive wine.",Château Grand Boise 2015 Cuvée Jadis Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Another study in citrus: bergamot peel mixes with fragrant citrus foliage on the nose. The palate brings further harmony with notes of orange and tangerine. The juicy freshness is utterly mouthwatering. The dry, slender palate is seriously playful and playfully serious. Only Riesling can achieve this. Utter joy and supreme refreshment.",Domäne Wachau 2015 Terrassen Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)
"Aloe vera balminess is promised on the zesty, aromatic nose. The palate fulfills this easily: this is supple and flowing, concentrated and fluid. White pepper, grapefruit zest, juicy pear and greenish leafiness all gather around the central seam of freshness. Elegance, poise and total refreshment is the result.",Eichinger 2015 Wechselberg Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose. Apple flesh and lime rind sizzles into the citrus-driven palate, where a touch of lemon verbena adds complexity to this straightforward and delicious wine.",Fess Parker 2014 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)
"Blackberry, cassis, mocha and chocolate aromas are typical of fine, modern Malbec, even if this contains 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. A flush, widespread mouthfeel expands across all corners of the palate, while savory, toasty flavors of blackberry and licorice finish with a reprise of char as well as hickory and coffee notes. Drink this beefy wine through 2022.",Finca El Origen 2011 Phi Single Vineyard Red (Valle de Uco)
"It's the stem inclusion that shows itself first, with aromas of olive and herb in front of violets, red fruit, pepper, earth and whiffs of coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are reserved, supple and polished, with bright acids keeping it all in focus. It demands food alongside it to be properly appreciated.",Gramercy 2013 John Lewis Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Black cherries, leather, dried rose petals, rustic cinnamon, bloody meat, graphite, cherry cola and vanilla bean show on the wondrously layered nose of this Steve Clifton bottling. It's still a tad young on the palate, which is grippy with sticky tannins, but shows cola, brown spice, cinnamon, cardamom cream, tart plum fruit and a lasting dried mint element. Drink 2018 through 2028.",Palmina 2008 Sisquoc Nebbiolo (Santa Maria Valley)
"The aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coconut and dried herbs are still quite locked up, with the oak out front. The cherry flavors are dense, plush and layered, with vanilla and other barrel spices speckled throughout. It provides plenty of immediate appeal but will only benefit from some time in the cellar; best after 2019.",Pursued by Bear 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Ripe, rich fruit and bold, mouth dampening tannins express the rugged muscularity of this wine. A blend of classic Bordeaux grape varieties, it highlights pristine black cherry and cassis against a backdrop of spice, cedar, barnyard and tobacco complexities. It needs a few years to ease off its brawniness, but should improve beautifully through at least 2023.",Raphael 2013 Primo Reserve Estate Bottled Red (North Fork of Long Island)
"Grown on the producer's 1,800-foot-high, dry-farmed property west of St. Helena from 40-year-old vines, this is a great wine, structured and elegantly designed to highlight cassis, clove and cigar. Thick, heady tannins soften in the glass, allowing room for enviable structure and a black pepper-dotted finish.",Smith-Madrone 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District)
"Given slightly less new oak (60%) than the producer's Les Sommets bottling, this is an equally rewarding wine, blended with 12% Merlot. Red fruit dominates atop a soft grip of leather, pencil lead and cedar. The considerable density of the tannins and overall firm texture suggest this will benefit from further aging; drink 2018–2022.",Les Belles Collines 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"This is a Westside Road site known for its rocky soils, and the wine presents sassafras, cherry-berry and roses on the entry before laying down a tightly woven mix of sour, salty cranberry and blood orange. It is softly voluptuous and velvety, though young, with a biting chewiness that should mellow in the cellar. Drink now through 2028.",Merry Edwards 2013 Flax Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Very dark and inky in color, this bottling by Matthias Pippig shows baked black plum and black cherry on the nose as well as a dusting of cocoa and elegant forest spices of juniper and pine. More baked plum and rich blueberry show on the palate, but with a considerably earthy edge of black tea, juniper, coffee and dark chocolate.",Sanguis 2013 My Soul Is Rested Red (Central Coast)
"This ultraripe Malbec-led blend suggests aged P. X. Sherry via raisin and citrus peel aromas. A jammy palate manages to exhibit balance, despite heavy ripeness, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune are dark and dense. A savory, warm, saturated finish continues the theme of maximum ripeness. Drink through 2020.",Alta Vista 2011 Alto Red (Mendoza)
"Piercing blueberry and wild berry aromas are prototypical of this label. A juicy, high-acid palate is linear and a bit edgy, but its composition bodes well for the future. Spiced plum and currant flavors finish with toast, spice and berry notes. Drink through 2024.",Achaval-Ferrer 2013 Finca Mirador Malbec (Mendoza)
"Opaque in color and manner, this wine benefits from the 5% addition of Malbec, a speciality of the producer. Juicy blue and black fruit intermix around a touch of milk chocolate, with smooth tannins and well-integrated oak. This is a classically styled wine balanced against a richness of California fruit.",Aperture 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Peach and bergamot, mirabelle plum and lemon zest, ripeness and freshness, amplitude and sleekness: whoever loves to trade in juxtapositions will love this expressive, irresistible wine. Etched with very clear contours it nonetheless delivers generous, gorgeous fruit.",Josef Jamek 2015 Ried Klaus Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)
"A larger offering from the producer from a selection of sites, this shows a prowess of blending in its grippy, classic elements of black pepper and currant, a focused display of savory edges around elusive fruit that makes for a compelling experience. Drink now through 2023.",Turnbull 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"The bottle carries the signature of French sculptor César, who marked his friendship with the Sumeire family, owners of the estate. The wine, the top cuvée of the property, is impressively rich while still being beautifully balanced and fresh. From selected parcels, it is a real food wine, tense with a good texture and a ripe, concentrated aftertaste.",Château Coussin 2015 Cuvée César à Sumeire Rosé (Côtes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)
"Always aged for a year before it is released, this iconic wine is impressive. It is superrich without losing freshness. Light wood toast, red fruits and balanced acidity meld together in a ripe, spicy whole. The wine could even age for another few months, so drink it this summer or keep until the end of 2016.",Château d'Esclans 2014 Garrus Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"This wine is from the Chenoweth grape-growing family and is made from three of its finest vineyard sites: Chenoweth Ranch, Treehouse and Bootleggers, all special spots that have produced grapes for special producers. Here, the result is a smooth and velvety expression of juicy cherry and raspberry, given freshness via vibrant acidity.",Chenoweth 2013 Pinot Noir (Green Valley)
"Red cherry, vanilla, chaparral scrub and cranberry puree show on the nose of this bottling from the longtime estate, and then come the intriguing olive and Middle Eastern spices. The palate hones in on that Mediterranean spice character, with Kalamata olives blending into lavender, exotic mulberry and thyme-laced cherry-plum sauce.",Claiborne & Churchill 2014 Classic Estate Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)
"A portion of this estate is in the cru appellation of La Londe, based on schist soil. This single-vineyard wine is impressive in its ripe fruit and vein of fresh acidity. It is full bodied and concentrated, while keeping a light touch. It is dry, lightly structured and likely will be even better from the end of 2016.",Domaine Saint-André de Figuière 2015 Confidentielle Rosé (Côtes de Provence La Londe)
"Slightly more advanced notes stand out: a herbal tinge of sun-warmed, wild thyme has crept into the citrus peel which utterly dominates the palate. This sleek Smaragd has just started on its long ascent. It has the toned muscle and the stamina to go on and on—those who have enjoyed older vintages know of its near eternal youthfulness. On the aftertaste, herbal notes assert themselves again: dried tisane of verbena and dried apple punctuate with pleasant accents.",Domäne Wachau 2013 Smaragd Terrassen Riesling (Wachau)
"Dark golden in color, this celebration of the Chinese zodiac opens with fresh-squeezed lemon and saline, a a saltiness that's inviting and imaginative. Medium in body, this is fleshy, juicy and bright, a complement of ripe apple and banana, a perfumed floral quality and spicy minerality.",Donum 2014 Year of the Horse Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)
"From vines averaging 95 years old, this is an impressive effort, in balance between savory, sultry overtones of peppercorn and espresso and a riper, juicier core of blackberry. Supportive acidity provides a freshness to the wine, which offers plenty of length and breadth on the finish.",Dry Creek Vineyard 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Elegant and silky on the nose, this bottling shows aromas of pressed violet, rose bud, grape candy, cherry blossom and lilac. There is a lot of cinnamon and star anise spice on the palate as well as a strong touch of licorice that's laid across deep olallieberry fruit and a lavender florality.",Fiddlehead 2011 Lollapalooza Fiddlestix Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Stemmy wet forest and a distinct note of mushroom opens this exotic wine, a full-bodied and concentrated expression of the coast. Tangy orange and juicy rhubarb flavors support the searing acidity that balances the wine and keeps it fresh and lively on the palate.",Foretell 2012 Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)
"Notes of buttered toast, butterscotch candy and caramel popcorn flavors dominate this wine. Underneath all that is a wine with pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",Taft Street 2011 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"Aromatically, this is pretty good as dry apple and a pinch of green herbs work the nose. In the mouth, however, this is shear and citric, with zesty, almost sour flavors of tangerine, orange and grapefruit. The finish is similar, with thinly cut acidity causing tartness.",Codorníu NV Gran Bach Sparkling (Cava)
"Burnt hay, grapefruit and waxy apple aromas lead to a palate with briny citrus flavors. Pithy grapefruit and orange flavors carry the finish, which is quick and light in weight.",Monte Clavijo 2012 Viura (Rioja)
This sparkling wine has a delicate fragrance of spring flowers and flavors of white fruit. Simple but well made and refreshing.,Piera Martellozzo NV 075 Carati  (Prosecco)
"This overly ripe Malbec is packed with rooty spice, oak and tree bark aromas. The wine feels sticky and soupy, with a resiny texture and salty, oaky flavors of syrupy berries and mint. A sugary, cloying finish is short on freshness.",Siesta Wines 2011 Padrillos Malbec (Mendoza)
"A scent of burnt sugar hits the nose first, followed by blasts of papaya and kiwi. The palate tastes off-dry, and it offers a caramelized flavor. The wine clings to the palate on the finish, which gives it some length.",Stanburn 2011 Meadow Breeze Sweet White (Virginia)
"A blend of 85% Merlot, 10% Syrah, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has an oxidative aroma that overrides the scents of cassis, blackberry, spiced mocha and vanilla. The medium-bodied palate feels soft and malleable, and it comes with a raisin-like edge. Finishes a bit short.",Vivác Winery 2007 V. by Vivác Single Vineyard Merlot (New Mexico)
"This is a light-bodied, simple wine, marked by brisk acidity and sour cherry candy flavors. Drink up.",Coquelicot 2010 Estate Sangiovese (Santa Ynez Valley)
"The nose is neutral except for dusty aromas and a hint of applesauce. This feels bold, thick and a bit clumsy, with pithy citrus, nectarine and apricot flavors. These notes continue through the wine's finish. Drink now.",Acordeón 2012 Chardonnay (Tupungato)
"Made without oak, this Riesling is slightly sweet with sugary orange and peach flavors. It lacks the acidity to balance the sweetness, which makes the finish cloying.",Bread & Butter 2012 Riesling (California)
"This is a thin, tart wine, with simple apricot, citrus, honey and peach flavors that finish sour and dry.",Castle Rock 2011 Pinot Grigio (Monterey County)
"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is as sweet as a candy. It has licorice, cherry, sweet cola and persimmon flavors.",Back Seat 2010 Brunette Red (California)
"There's a hard, metallic flavor and feeling. Under that are good black cherry and cola flavors, touched with sweet, smoky oak. It's okay with basic burgers and barbecue.",Brander 2010 Cabernet Franc (Santa Ynez Valley)
"Earthy in character, this is a rustic wine. It does have attractive red fruits, and balancing acidity but these elements come up against a barnyard character and firm tannins.",Château Nozières 2011 Malbec (Cahors)
"The nose is yeasty with aromas of apple and hay stalks. This feels lively and citrusy, although the structure and bubble bead are weak. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine finish with a pickled flavor and juicy acidity.",Domaine Jean Bousquet NV Brut Methode Traditionnelle  (Tupungato)
"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.",Tamarí 2011 Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Grassy aromas of green tobacco and alfalfa come in front of a lightly abrasive palate. Herbal red-berry flavors are suggestive of minty cranberry, cherry and raspberry. This turns more fruity and less green on the finish.",Vinícola de Castilla 2011 Finca del Castillo Joven Tempranillo (La Mancha)
"This has restrained aromas of char, cassis, spice and asparagus. It's light to medium in body, and it bears fine, polished tannins. A note of cherry marks the warm finish.",Vivác Winery 2008 Diavolo Red (New Mexico)
"This is a thin, water wine with delicate grapefruit flavor. The finish is brightened by a burst of citrusy acidity.",Mirassou 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (California)
"As delicate as water, with faint hints of citrus fruits and buttered toast.",Castle Rock 2012 Chardonnay (Central Coast)
"A scent of tar hits the nose first, followed by whiffs of raisin, brown spice and vanilla. The attack on this wine feels flat and flaccid, but the tannins pick up slightly on the midpalate, which lends it some structure.",Mount Pleasant Winery NV Dry Norton (Missouri)
"Inexpensive, this Zin is quite ripe and quite oaky, a big mouthful of wine ready to enjoy now.",Damas 2010 Zinfandel (Fiddletown)
"Aromas of bees wax and clover honey come with some volatility. The palate tastes a touch bitter and high pitched, and the acidity feels flat. A note of honey-infused breakfast tea surfaces on the palate.",Doukénie 2011 Pinot Grigio (Virginia)
"Briny raspberry aromas are a bit murky. This smacks down hard with acidity, while the flavors run toward earthy, generic plum and berry. A salty finish with animal notes is firm but struggles with cleanliness.",Casa de Campo 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)
"Superripe pineapple, lemonade and apricot flavors, coupled with acidity, give this Viognier a candied sweet-and-sour taste.",Ranchero Cellars 2012 La Vista Vineyard Viognier (Paso Robles)
"Tastes like an old wine that Nonno brought up from the basement in a carafe. It's supposedly a Bordeaux blend, but it could be anything red and full-bodied.",San Antonio 2009 Cask 520 Red (Paso Robles)
"This is not a successful Sleepy Hollow Vineyard bottling. The cold vintage took its toll, resulting in a wine whose cherry and tart cranberry flavors are cut through with a streak of green veggies. Drink up.",Talbott 2011 Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A maderized color and flat, old-smelling aromas of molasses and baked beans are barely cutting it. This feels tired, with mildly oxidized flavors of raisin, tobacco and vanilla. Tomato and herbal notes carry the finish on this mostly gone Rioja.",Urbina 2007 Crianza  (Rioja)
"Thin in fruit and sharp in acidity, this Merlot at least is dry and silky on the palate. It has raisin and oak flavors.",Castle Rock 2011 Merlot (Central Coast)
"A very dusty aroma gives a wine that has pepper, green apple and a metallic edge. Finishing with bright acidity, it is ready to drink.",Cave de Cleebourg 2011 Pinot Auxerrois (Alsace)
"Among Genium's fine lineup of 2010 Priorat reds, this one stands out for it's schisty nose of cherry, currant and raspberry. A ripe, layered, chiseled palate is tough but rewarding. Cherry, cassis and plum flavors finish fiery and minerally, even by Priorat standards. Drink through 2025.",Genium Celler 2010 Ecològic Red (Priorat)
Miso and yeast are met by lemon zest and pear peel. The palate is streamlined and slender and homes in on a central vein of beautiful grass and herb-scented freshness. This literally dances on and off the palate and leaves you with wonder that such lightness can have so much flavor.,Geyerhof 2015 Rosensteig Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"For now, funky yeast dominates the nose. The palate, however, abounds with friendly yellow Mirabelle plum and mandarin notes, all pulled into beautiful focus by lemon freshness. There is concentration and drive, energy and verve. This is beautiful, impressive and yet friendly and gentle. Lovely balance and aromatic length.",Geyerhof 2015 Sprinzenberg Riesling (Kremstal)
"Produced mainly from young Cabernet Sauvignon vines on the Château Smith Haut Lafitte vineyard, this is a solid, dark and dense wine. It has rich black-currant flavors that are cut by acidity and firm tannins. Both mean the wine needs to age, so drink from 2020.",Château Smith Haut Lafitte 2011 Le Petit Haut Lafitte  (Pessac-Léognan)
"From the Layon Valley with its ability to produce botrytised grapes from the morning mists in the autumn, this wine is rich, sweet with orange marmalade and honey flavors. The contrast with the acidity is what makes this wine so light, perfumed and poised. It needs to age, so drink from 2019.",Domaine du Petit Métris 2014 Les Tétuères Chenin Blanc (Coteaux du Layon Chaume)
"Another tiny production, made in a different style from many of the other designates released by the producer this year, Ten Oaks is named for the, yes, 10 trees bordering the vineyard. Medium in tannin and oak, with a surprising lightness of being, it shows a citrus-like quality that makes it refreshing, while a sublime texture keeps rolling along the tongue.",Donum 2013 Ten Oaks Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"The aromas of embers, black pepper, dark fruit, herbs, smoke and spice are brooding and locked up on first pour, showing more on each swirl. The blue and black-fruit flavors are ripe, sweet and full, with savory notes fleshing out the crazy long finish.",Efeste 2013 Eleni Red Willow Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)
"Floral, citrus aromas, honeylike flavors and an unctuous texture make this white Rhône-style blend almost a dessert in a glass—without being sweet. The wine is full bodied, mouthfilling, complex and gushing with great pastry-like flavors.",Elyse 2013 L'Ingenue White (Sierra Foothills)
"Berry, eucalyptus, Alpine herb and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll discover on this structured red. The ripe, fresh palate offers juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cooking spice and licorice alongside firm but refined tannins. Drink 2020–2032.",Francesco Rinaldi 2012 Brunate  (Barolo)
"The variety announces itself with aromas of dark plum, fig, herbs and blackberry bud that enchant the senses. The fruit flavors are soft and plush, showing a dazzling sense of purity along with a finish that lingers. It flat out impresses.",Baer 2013 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))
"There's an immediate pithy tension on the nose of this bottling from a producer in the game since 1933, with Brie-cheese rind, fresh Greek yogurt and and grapefruit-peel aromas. The flavors are intriguing, hard to pin down and alluring, with exotic citrus and varied stone fruit, light honeysuckle and crushed slate mixed with chalky structure. Simmering acidity keeps the flavors coming.",Bargetto 2014 Regan Vineyards Reserve Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"Pure notes of ripe but crisp pear on the nose turn into concentrated, herb-spiced pear and citrus notes on the palate: the ripeness of the pear vies with the zesty freshness and makes of a lively, vivid and most enjoyable and refreshing wine. This is crisp, light bodied but balanced and puts a little Austrian spring in your step.",Buchegger 2015 Gebling Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"With a dominance of Merlot in the blend, this Saint-Émilion-classed growth has ripe, jammy fruits and softening tannins. It is dense and concentrated with big blackberry fruits that have a touch of spice and pepper from the alcohol. The wine is rich and ready to drink now and until 2024.",Château de Ferrand 2012  Saint-Émilion
"Candied red cherries mix with eucalyptus oil on the nose of this bottling that also offers an intriguingly feral aroma of pine needles smashed into wet earth. There is great depth on the sip, with stewed cranberries and strawberries, graphite minerality and then more eucalyptus, pine needles and sharp forest herbs.",Hensteeth 2012 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County)
"Yeasty, miso-like savor dominates the fresh aroma, however, the palate adds wonderfully zesty lime notes and a rounder, more sonorous and richer component of yellow pear. All this comes together in an appetizing, refreshing and most satisfying package. The wine's punchy concentration is lightly worn, the finish is clean.",Hiedler 2015 Spiegel Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"Minty, oaky, smoky aromas of ripe blackberry draw you towards a saturated, full-bodied palate with hard tannins. Blackberry, cassis, pepper and chocolate flavors form a fine team, while this finishes with molten-chocolate richness but also heat and tannic clamp. Drink through 2028.",Lecco 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)
"The color of this wine is deep and dark, and the aromas and flavors both have lots of plump black cherry, baking spice and clove tones. It's dry, full bodied and pretty massive in terms of mouthfeel, so this is not a delicate flower and is best enjoyed with heartier fare or after some time to open.",Maggy Hawk 2013 Stormin' Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"Light and delicate aromas of lime curd, vanilla yogurt and a touch of pear custard show in a very pleasing manner on the nose of this vineyard-blend bottling.

"Aromas of green herbs, flowers, earth and mineral start out quite brooding. The smoked meat and savory flavors are very pretty, showing a light touch. The finish lingers.",Saviah 2012 The Stones Speak Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Aromas of iris, exotic incense, leather, woodland berry and a whiff of Alpine herb lift out of the glass. On the succulent, chewy palate, velvety tannins wrap around ripe Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice and tobacco. It's delicious and already almost accessible. Drink 2018–2025.",Sobrero 2010 Pernanno Riserva  (Barolo)
"Baked red plum, black cherry, sagebrush, graphite and budding hibiscus aromas show on the rich and minerally nose of this bottling.

"Aromas of leather, flint, toast, menthol and exotic spice come together in the glass along with a floral note.

A mineral note closes the finish.",Tenuta delle Terre Nere 2014 Calderara Sottana  (Etna)
"A tempting aroma of vanilla and cream leads to mouthfilling fruit and baking-spice flavors in this full-bodied, plush-textured and concentrated wine. The details of bright fruit and nutmeg weave through an almost unctuous sensation on the palate and linger nicely on the finish.",The Tribe 2015 Chardonnay (Lodi)
"Everything is still tightly coiled: the intense Conference pear fruit, the zesty lime notes, the deeply herbal savoriness. For now, the refreshing lime peel notes are chief amongst its charms but allow this to relax for just a little and this will be a quintessential summer wine of concentration and utter refreshment.",Türk 2015 Kremser Weinberge Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal)
"Additions of Sauvignon Musque and Sauvignon Gris add complexity to this rewarding white, full bodied and rounded in anise, creamy vanilla and apricot tones. Succulent and lengthy, it teases in an underbelly of herb and grass. It saw stainless-steel fermenting plus time in French oak, chestnut and acacia.",Dry Creek Vineyard 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)
"Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs.",Efeste 2013 Ceidleigh Syrah (Red Mountain)
"The white-pepper, garrigue, raspberry, orange-peel and pot-roast aromas pop. The palate is action packed with raspberry and cranberry flavors that lead to a long, savory finish.",Efeste 2013 Emmy Stone Tree Vineyard Mourvèdre (Wahluke Slope)
"A totally aromatic, floral and rose-spiced nose makes for an unusually fragrant Grüner. The palate shows the same floral spiciness, edged with exotic lychee amidst peppery spice, sprightly lemon acid and Grüner's telltale phenolic edge. This packs in a whole lot of flavor. Make sure you savor every last nuance.",Esterházy 2015 Estoras Grüner Veltliner (Burgenland)
"Mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (74%) with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this wine starts out brooding, with aromas of coffee, spice, vanilla, plum, dark fruit and high-toned herbs. The cherry and barrel spice flavors coat the palate, backed by firm tannins that need time to soften.",Fidelitas 2013 Optu Red (Red Mountain)
"Pan-seared apple flesh, light jasmine, white lily, chamomile, lemongrass and sandstone aromas show on the delicate nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in the foothills east of Salinas.

"Relatively full, and perfumed with grapes from the Muscat family, this is a perfect apéritif wine. It has a texture of pear skins, with kiwi fruit and a final finishing softness, lifted by very fresh, dry acidity. Screwcap.",Gunter Triebaumer 2008 Trie Weiss White (Burgenland)
"Definitely on the grassy, herbaceous side, this second white wine of Vieux Château Gaubert has freshness. But it is the intensity of its grapefruit, gooseberry and green kiwi flavors that are dominant, given an extra edge of some spice.",Vieux Château Gaubert 2008 Benjamin  (Graves)
"Aromas of mineral, smoke and floral black fruit are attractive, while the palate is focused and nimble, with red fruit, rhubarb and herbal notes. There's a wild, rather natural character to this wine along with a solid finish that brings herb flavors and medium tannic bite.",Viña Casablanca 2007 Nimbus Estate Single Vineyard Syrah (Casablanca Valley)
"Crisp, citrusy and slightly herbal, this is a well made, mainstream Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc at a terrific price.",Zeal 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Dimension and a broad feel characterize this Extra Dry Prosecco—the added density is probably due to the small percentages of Perera and Verdiso that are blended in. You'll get aromas of stone fruit, melon, apricot and white flower. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly sweet.",Andreola Orsola NV Vigneto Dirupo Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Floral intensity along with stone fruit, citrus blossoms and honeydew melon describe the fruity nose of this pale golden sparkler. The quality of the foaming is soft and generous in the mouth and the wine offers cheerful sweetness on the close.",Antonini Ceresa NV Extra Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Here's a classic Prosecco Dry with a fragrant nose and generous layers of white flower, stone fruit, peach and talc powder. The bubbling is soft and creamy and the wine offers light sweetness on the close.",Bellussi NV Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"Dominated by toasty, coconutty aromas, with just hints of peach and hazelnut. Hold six months and see what emerges; right now, this wine is defined more by technique (barrel-fermentation and aging) than terroir.",Château d'Esclans 2007 Les Clans Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"Good price for a sophisticated Cab you can substitute for more expensive bottlings without apologizing. The wine is rich in black currants, blackberry jam and spicy oak, accented by savory herbs and spices.",Christine Andrew 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)

"Here is an oak-aged sparkler from Italy's Lake Garda (made with Chardonnay) that boasts thick density and creamy aromas of almond, peach, butter and yellow rose. It makes for a well-priced alternative to more expensive metodo classico sparkling wines from France and Spain.",Costaripa NV Brut  (Lugana)

"This notable Gewürtz starts with an aromatic, fresh fruit nose—melon, flowers—tinged with spice. On the palate, the wine offers an elegant array of white fruit, citrus and spice flavors and a shot of balancing acidity.

Imported by Bluewater Wine Company.,Strait Jacket 2007 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Western Australia)
"This is a distinctive Prosecco (from the 2007 vintage) with aromas of chopped white pepper, minerals, mature lemon, stone fruit and honey. The wine showcases a sweet-versus-sour theme and ends with lively acidity. The blend sees 15% Verdiso, Perera and Bianchetta for more density and thickness.",Val d'Oca 2007 Uvaggio Storico Dry  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A little candied and jumpy on the nose, with floral, grapey aromas. The palate is wide and stocky, with grabby tannins that turn the flavors of bold berry and plum a bit thick. Fruity and extracted on the finish; good wine but needs some refinement to match the big size.",Viña Santa Cruz 2006 Chamán Gran Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley)
"Knoll's simplest Riesling is super-fresh, floral, aromatic. The white berry fruits are dominant, supported by a tight line of acidity. It is, of course, very young, not yet ready to drink, its citric character dominant. It needs a year at least.",Emmerich Knoll 2008 Loibner Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)
"This lively Riesling offers aromas of citrus, apricot and honey, followed by layers of white fruit, spice and pepper. The wine has a slightly sweet fruity character but it's balanced by acid and minerals. A fun but impressive Riesling.",Fox Run 2007 Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Dark and minerally, with black fruits, char and power on the nose. The palate is fresh and grippy, with integrated cassis, berry and herb flavors. Dry and lightly herbal on the finish, which is long and solid. A very nice blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.",Calcu 2008 Red Wine Red (Colchagua Valley)
"Pine and herb and green apple scents introduce this sharply defined wine, with crisp acidity and bright fruit flavors. It's tight and juicy, an excellent companion to creamy dishes or soft cheeses.",Cave B 2009 Unoaked Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Currants, cherry and cocoa aromas give this Cabernet a luscious start. On the palate, a smoky wave of cherry, blackberry and cedar is both exotic and likeable. This is a tight wine but has appealing fruit accents.",Hatzimichalis 2007 Estate Hatzimichalis Cabernet Sauvignon (Atalanti Valley)
"Sourced from Marlborough's main valley, this is a nicely made example of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Grapefruit and crushed tomato-leaf notes mingle easily, backed by ripe, vaguely tropical fruit. It's medium in body, finishing clean and refreshing.",Goldwater 2010 Sauvignon Blanc (Wairau Valley)
"This Syrah is really attractive upfront, with aromas of sweet pastry crust, baked plum, licorice and cracked pepper. The plum and blackberry fruit is balanced by some savory elements on the palate, which doesn't show a lot of weight or length. A pretty wine to drink over the next couple of years.",Gunn Estate 2007 Silistria Syrah (Hawke's Bay)
"Like most California Tempranillos, this one's dry, acidic and rich in red cherry fruit, cola and beef jerky flavors. It's a pleasant wine, with a silky, light mouthfeel. Try as an interesting alternative to Pinot Noir.",Bella Luna 2008 Tempestuous Tempranillo (San Benito County)
"Just a touch of oak adds a welcome creamy smokiness to this dry, crisply acidic wine. It's superrich in ripe lychee, Mandarin orange, sweet lime and spice flavors. Refreshing and clean, it's a nice cocktail sipper.",Benessere 2009 Pinot Grigio (Carneros)

"Nicely concentrated with a core of ripe red fruit and menthol, this is a fresh, forward Cab that's a bargain at $8. Bright and clean from start to finish, the finish lingers on smooth, velvety tannins and a fresh, herbaceous mint note.",Vini 2009 Veni Vidi Vici Cabernet Sauvignon (Thracian Valley)
"This crisp red blend from the Langhe in northern Italy offers sharp notes of dill and green olive backed by forest berry and white cherry. There's a taut, linear feel that is enhanced by the wine's fine, compact texture.",Virna Borgogno 2008 Red (Langhe)
"Rich and showy, but a little too strong in everything, showing flamboyant tropical fruit, caramelized oak, butterscotch and sweet vanilla cream flavors. It's all quite delicious, but the wine ultimately lacks subtlety and distinction, especially at this price.",Hestan 2008 Chardonnay (San Francisco Bay)
"This is a simple, fruit-forward Nebbiolo with ripe notes of strawberry and raspberry jam backed by light shadings of tobacco and spice. The wine shows bright acidity and clean, polished tannins.",Cascina Bruciata 2008 Usignolo Nebbiolo (Langhe)
"This is a thick and vinous Dolcetto with bright grape and blueberry aromas followed by a touch of rubber and spice. It offers a slightly sweet aftertaste with dense, plump concentration.",Cascina Bruciata 2009 Vigneti in Rio Sordo  (Dolcetto d'Alba)

"Extraordinarily rich and sweet in raspberry, cherry, vanilla custard, brown sugar and cinnamon spice flavors. Soft and somewhat sugary on the finish, it shows lots of ripe California fruit, but would benefit from being drier.",Château Julien 2007 Black Nova III Malbec-Syrah (Monterey County)

"Dark and dense up front, with leathery, beefy aromas that suggest weight and size. The palate is indeed round and full, while the flavors are herbal and savory as you dig through blackberry and fig. Hefty, a little hot and a bit baked on the finish.",De Martino 2008 Legado Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)
"This is rounded and soft, with wood and spice flavors. There's an intriguing touch of ginger, along with a salty, mineral character.",Domaine Jacques Prieur 2009 Champs Pimont Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"Sweet and candied, this Zin, which is a blend of Mount Veeder and Oakville fruit, is obviously superripe in blackberries, cherries, raspberries, mocha and dusty baking spices. It's sweet in fruity essence but nicely dry on the finish. Drink now with barbecue, baked ham, soft cheeses.",Fontanella 2009 Zinfandel (Napa Valley)

Fresh and fruity with a mineral backbone, the wine finishes on an earthy spin. Pair with grilled sardines or poultry dishes.",Tsililis 2015 Theopetra Malagouzia-Assyrtiko White
"Perhaps the greatest way to taste this legendary winery in an affordable way, this appellation-blend bottling shows baked bramble pie, dried chaparral scrub, licorice, roasted beef and allspice on the palate. The plump blackberry and black-cherry fruit is leveled by rocky minerality and clove spice, all boosted by long lasting acidity.",Williams Selyem 2014 Pinot Noir (Central Coast)
"Plump blackberries and ready-to-pop cherries are laced with touches of fresh tobacco, graphite and turned earth on this very well done Cab. The rich black plum fruit of the palate is cut by a strong acidity and firm tannic grip, with flavors of pencil lead keeping the wine serious and driven.",Zaca Mesa 2013 Homage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara)
"Saracina makes dazzling white wines, but this intense red is outstanding too. Dark fruits like blackberry mingle with bright raspberry in this hefty, substantial wine that's full bodied and handsomely tannic. It's dry, very textural in the mouth and concentrated well enough for a lingering finish.",Saracina 2013 Pick and Shovel Zinfandel (Mendocino County)
"This wine gives a big bear hug with aromas like wild berries and black pepper. Then sweet oak and rich, savory plum flavors emerge on the palate as the ripeness comes through. The finish is long and reverberates with the nutmeg spiciness of perfectly seasoned barrels.",Skinner 2012 Eighteen Sixty-One Red (El Dorado)
"Imposing, concentrated and tannic, this Syrah-based blend needs time to mature and soften. It has vivid aromas and flavors of black pepper, clove, cranberry and dark chocolate plus an almost rigid mouthfeel from a thick underpinning of fine tannins. The distinctive flavors match the powerful structure, so it should age well. Best to drink after 2020.",The Withers Winery 2013 Mr. Burgess Red (El Dorado)
"Ripe, lusty blackberry, cherry and earth aromas are accented by woodsy spice scents. This is full in body, with firm tannins that provide structure. Flavors of mixed berry fruits, toasty oak and related spice run deep, while this Tempranillo is staunch on the finish, with mildly abrasive tannins. Drink through 2022.",Leda 2010 Viñas Viejas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León)
"Riojas of this quality and price are not a dime a dozen. This ripe, delicious wine shows all the virtues of a great vintage. Earthy, roasted berry aromas are pure, ripe and magnetic. This feels full, tannic and strapping, while flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate are supported by generous but appropriate oak. Mocha, espresso and black-fruit residuals grace a fine finish. Drink through 2022.",Marqués de Cáceres 2010 Reserva  (Rioja)
"A lightly perfumed nose of white flowers, fresh herbs and dry stone fruits sets up a round, elegant palate with no coarseness. Briny, slightly salty citrus flavors are focused and steely, while a steady, mildly salty finish is in great shape and confirms this bubbly's high level of quality and purity. Drink through 2019.",Raventós I Blanc 2011 Textures'de Pedra Blanc de Negres Sparkling (Spain)
"Joyously ripe, this lip-smackingly fruity wine sings of a summer's bounty of peach, apricot and orange flavors. Its alter ego is deeply mineral though, anchoring the palate in electric strikes of steel and slate. Delightfully crisp, its honeyed finish wraps up surprisingly dry.",Reinhold Haart 2014 Wintricher Ohligsberger Grosse Lage Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"This is an earthy, ethereal, lighter-bodied wine. It's satisfyingly varietal and shines in blue fruit, sarsaparilla, strawberry hulls and touches of a forest floor's trove of mushrooms. Well-hewn acidity gives it a freshness and structure with a background of firm tannin.",Gros Ventre 2013 Campbell Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"There's a lot to like in this soft, juicy wine, bright in red fruit and notable in its gentle texture. Quietly powerful and full-bodied without being overdone, it has balance and elegance, with a meaty underbrush.",Havens 2014 Syrah (Napa Valley)
"A very ripe, sweet boysenberry aroma sets the tone for this very full-bodied, fruit-drenched wine. It fairly oozes blackberry flavors, feels rich and broad on the palate and has a firm but not very tannic texture. It's easy to enjoy this exuberant wine now through 2023.",Liparita 2013 V Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"This bright and spicy wine is packed with botanical flavors. The aromatics are pungent and intense, pushing sharp notes of lime, Meyer lemon and orange soda deep into the palate. In some ways this has the penetrating density of Gewürztraminer. It's bold and distinctive, though clearly different from other domestic Viogniers.",Spangler 2015 Viognier (Southern Oregon)
"Tasted at their regular release date less than a year after the vintage, the Tahbilk Marsannes aren't terribly expressive. The key is bottle age, and this Museum Release has it. Lemon custard and thyme are tinged with hints of toast and marmalade in this medium-bodied white. A touch of creaminess on the midpalate extends through a long finish.",Tahbilk 2009 Museum Release Marsanne (Nagambie Lakes)
"Ah, this wine is distinctive and practically haunting in personality, as wild, earthy, sage and mushroom aromas meet meaty, savory, mineral-like flavors on a well-balanced frame of good acidity and appetizing, fine-grained tannins.",Terre Rouge 2013 Mourvèdre (Sierra Foothills)
"Outcrop was planted in 1982. A hint of leather (not too much) along with scents of sassafras and crushed roses, open into a peppery palate with cranberries and red fruits. Ample acidity carries it into a penetrating finish. Drink 2020 through 2035 and beyond.",The Eyrie Vineyards 2013 Outcrop Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"An abundance of fresh fruit spills out of this full-bodied, pure and uncomplicated wine in a way that's hard to resist. There is little obvious oak to get in the way of flavors like vine-ripened raspberries and blackberries as they stream along on fine tannins and lithe acidity.",Three 2013 Live Oak Zinfandel (Contra Costa County)
"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style.

"There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec. A muscular, powerful wine, it's intense in hay and herb, the finish veering savory to the point of sour.",Krupp Brothers 2009 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"From a cold vintage, this coastal Malbec offerssnappy cherry and boysenberry aromas along with woody spice notes. The palate is wiry and fresh, with zesty acidity. Tart plum and berry flavors end with raw oak and bitterness as the wine's modest fruit content fades out.",Lomas del Valle 2013 Coastal Cool Climate Single Vineyard Malbec (Casablanca Valley)
"Showing its youthful side, this is a breathtakingly fresh wine with intense acidity and tight grapefruit flavors. It's the style of Muscadet that really needs to soften for a few months and round out, when it will be very drinkable.",Marquis de Goulaine 2013 Le Puy Ferrand Sur Lie  (Muscadet Sèvre et Maine)

"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, this has funky, yeasty aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit that turn citrusy and briny if given time. On the palate, this recalls orange juice.

"Fresh on the front end, this offers lean, citrusy aromas suggestive of grapefruit and lime. A citric, cutting palate brings lime, green apple and pickled mango flavors in front of a zesty but basic finish. Drink now.",Echeverria 2014 Reserva Sauvignon Blanc (Curicó Valley)

"Coming from a cool vintage, this shows notes of green herbs, vanilla and black cherry. It's somewhat lean in feel with puckering acids and chalky tannins.",Stemilt Creek 2010 A Day's Work Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Equal parts Syrah and Merlot with a dash of Mourvèdre and Cabernet Franc (3% each), this wine brings notes of biscuit, cherry, dill and dried cranberry. Like many wines from this vintage in Washington, it's quite tart out of the gate, supported by chewy tannins.",Stemilt Creek 2010 Boss Lady Estate Grown Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

"Surprisingly shy in aromas at first, this eventually releases pleasing elements of mace, nutmeg, star anise and red cherry. The palate is softly lush and earthy, with black rocks, heavy black plum, hoisin sauce, boysenberry and a cola character. With quite strong structure, this will smooth and grow more delicious with time. Drink 2018–2028.",Foxen 2013 Melville Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"A few swirls of the glass release engaging aromas of baking spice, red berry, rose and a whiff of tar. The linear, elegantly structured palate boasts bright wild cherry, white pepper, cinnamon and a mineral note alongside vibrant acidity and assertive but refined tannins. It's still rather austere but should blossom into a beauty after a few more years in the cellar. Enjoy after 2019.",La Prevostura 2010 Muntacc Red (Coste della Sesia)
"Red fruit aromas are a bit rough and scalped in front of a chunky palate. Charred, burnt, oaky flavors of raspberry and cassis stress ripeness and weight before finishing with buttery oak, a slightly greasy feel and roasted berry flavors. Drink through 2020.",Lecco 2009 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)

"While barrel-influenced and full-bodied, this unctuous wine remains crisp in edgy acidity, with lean flavors of lemon and grapefruit amidst a deeper, richer background of oak and caramel.",Merryvale 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)
"A strongly wood aged wine, powered by tannins and dense fruits, it is concentrated and still young enough for the wood to show through although the fruit is developing well. This is a structured wine that will need plenty of time to age so drink from 2018.",Adega de Favaios 2012 Casa Velha Colheita Seleccionada Red (Douro)
"One of the most beautiful package designs in the state introduces a fresh and toasty wine that translates this cool, wet vintage into a most delicate and enjoyable bottle of Pinot. Light cranberry and cherry fruit is set in a gently proportional bed of tart acid and pretty oak, 40% new.",Antiquum Farm 2013 Juel Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Firm and polished, this barrel-fermented wine is just rounded off enough, without damping the bright, almost crunchy fruit. There's a light touch of toast and the structure for further bottle age to improve it. Drink 2017–2025.",Bethel Heights 2013 Estate Chardonnay (Eola-Amity Hills)
"A striking shade of amber/orange, this soft and fruity wine is open and loose knit, with broad flavors of mature, slightly oxidized tree fruits, plus lightly spicy notes of cinnamon and baking spices. It's very well made, but well apart from any standard approach.",Big Table Farm 2014 Wirtz Vineyard Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas of perfumed berry, mint baking spice, toast and espresso waft out of the glass. The palate is tight and rather primary at the moment, showing raw black cherry, raspberry, clove and toasted notes. It's still young but balanced, with fresh acidity and firm, fine–grained tannins. Drink 2016–2022.",Brandini 2011 Brandini  (Barolo)

"In keeping with the style of dessert wine in this region, this wine is beautifully balanced between acidity and intense sweetness. Together they give a wine that is so fresh, packed with a crisp texture as well as ripe apricot and white peach flavors that are just touched by honey. Drink now for its freshness, although it will be even better if aged until 2018.",Château de Gayon 2010 Gouttes de Soleil  (Pacherenc du Vic Bilh)
"Although red cherry and raspberry make an appearance, this vineyard-designate is otherwise all about forested pine and earthy pungency, accented by a pretty floral tease of rose petal. High in acidity and tannin, it takes time in the glass to settle down and find its balance, with a lengthy finish of black licorice and clove.",Della 2013 Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"This is a wine that reveals the younger side of Moscatel in Setúbal. It shows honey, spice and perfumed fruitiness that contrast with the richness of the texture and its fresh peach and apricot flavors. Drink now for immediate enjoyment.",José Maria da Fonseca 2010 Alambre  (Moscatel de Setúbal)
"This is a finely integrated, rich wine that shows impeccable balance between dusty tannins and juicy dark berry tones. The wood aging shows through in a smooth texture that gives a sense of richness to the ripe fruit. This is an elegant wine that can be drunk now although it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2017.",José Maria da Fonseca 2013 Periquita Reserva Red (Península de Setúbal)
"Engaging aromas of fresh rose, iris, perfumed berry and hint of menthol meld together in the glass. On the taut palate, notes of white pepper, clove and anise add some depth to the sour cherry core. Assertive tannins and nervous acidity offer focused support while a hint of juicy raspberry backs up the finish. Drink 2018–2026.",Le Strette 2011 Pallaretta  (Barolo)
"Smooth, deep aromas of licorice and blackberry are composed. This Mencía feels full and lusty, with grip but nothing too hard or edgy. Earthy black fruit flavors are savory, toasty and meaty, while the finish is woody and plump. Drink through 2020.",Luna Beberide 2012 Art Mencía (Bierzo)
"Despite its richness, this is a stylish wine that exudes freshness as much as dense fruit and structure. A blend of Touriga Nacional, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, all structured varieties, it still yields a generous full-bodied and rounded wine. It does need to age, so drink from 2018.",Magnum Vinhos 2012 Maria Mora Enamorada Red (Alentejano)
"Resiny oak and mildly stalky berry aromas muscle out cherry and raspberry scents. This feels grabby and clampy, while oaky flavors of mixed berries and baked plum end with coconut-infused oak flavors and notes of raisin and licorice. Drink through 2020.",Rioja Vega 2010 Reserva  (Rioja)
"This wine is dark red-violet color to the eye, offering aromas of blackberry, roasted red pepper and juniper berry.

There is a slightly dominant eucalyptus flavor that backs off at the finish, replaced by a fresh cherry juice flavor.",Segal's 2012 Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"A red-violet color, this wine has a bouquet of blackberry, lilac and pencil lead with a whiff of iodine.

"Enticing aromas of pressed rose, iris and perfumed berry lead the nose, with a whiff of cake spice on this straightforward red. The elegant, enjoyable palate offers sour red cherry, raspberry, white pepper and a hint star anise alongside firm, refined tannins. A tobacco note signals the close.",Travaglini 2010  Gattinara
"While racy and spry, this delicately framed wine packs a punch of honeyed peach and nectarine flavors. It's effusively fresh, floral and fruity, yet accentuated by a crystalline sheen of minerality. Drink now.",Dr. Heidemanns-Bergweiler 2014 Bernkasteler Badstube Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Waxy apple stars in this brisk, approachable white from a single estate-farmed block, the oak briny and salty in toast and honey. Textured and elegantly light bodied, it finishes with a satisfying note of lemon candy.",Dry Creek Vineyard 2013 DCV Estate Block 10 Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)
"The nose on this appellation blend is full of soft tones of ripe nectarine and pluot, though cut with walnut oil and a citrus edge. It's more pithy in flavor, showing orange bitters, dried apples and more nut oils, slightly oxidative in style.",Wedell Cellars 2012 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Old-vine fruit delivers an elegant Pinot that combines low alcohol with graceful details of pretty spices and red fruits. Young, tangy cherry flavors are precisely defined, with a delicate tension. This might very well improve dramatically with a decade or more of cellaring. Drink 2020–2030.",Winderlea 2013 Maresh Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)
"A rich nose of cedar, balsamic, vanilla and spice leads this red from Greece. Black fruit, spice and tobacco on the palate is structured and serious. A balanced, cellarworthy wine with class.",Claudia Papayianni 2006 Red (Macedonia)
"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.",Emilio Moro 2008 Finca Resalso  (Ribera del Duero)
"Here's a bright, ruby-colored Rosso di Montalcino with subdued aromas of forest floor, white mushroom and pressed wildflower. It's a delicate but territory-driven wine with good intensity of red fruit flavor in the mouth. Pair it with steak and wild mushroom cream sauce.",Fattoria dei Barbi 2008  Rosso di Montalcino
"This has all the touchstones of good Chardonnay: just enough body and richness, apple, pineapple and melon fruit flavors and a crisp, citrusy finish. Solid Chardonnay for under $10.",Henry's Drive Vignerons 2009 Morse Code Chardonnay (Padthaway)
"Very ripe, to the point of overripe. The blackberries and black currants veer into raisins, and there's a hint of raisinskin tartness that, combined with the strong tannins, adds to the tough mouthfeel. Will probably soften with age, without necessarily gaining complexity.",Envy 2007 Envy Estate Vineyard Petite Sirah (Napa Valley)
"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.",Finca Sophenia 2008 Reserve Merlot (Tupungato)
"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.",Trapiche 2008 Broquel Malbec (Mendoza)
"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",Trapiche 2009 Broquel Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.",Trapiche 2009 Oak Cask Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.",Trivento 2008 Reserve Syrah (Mendoza)
"This shows the sharper, more herbaceous side of the grape, though perhaps without being fully ripe. It seems to fall away quickly into simple lemon juice flavors, with a hint of herb.",Vin du Lac 2008 LEHM Sauvignon Blanc (Chelan County)
"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Bodegas del Muni 2008 Corpus del Muni Roble Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.",Bodegas Palacio 2006 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja)
"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth. The fruit flavors are good and mostly pure as they settle on black cherry and blackberry, while the finish is jammy but short. For $8 this should not disappoint.",Capa 2008 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)
"A menthol/eucalyptus note shoots through the aroma of this pleasant Cabernet. It shows quickly maturing flavors of plum and pie cherry, an easy-drinking softness throughout the mid-palate, and just a hint of heat in the finish.",Domaine Pouillon 2007 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A lean style bringing out acidity from the juicy black currant fruits. It has definite tannins supporting the fruit, while it finishes with fresh, perhaps too fresh, acidity.",J. & F. Lurton 2008 Barco Negro Red (Douro)
"The Nugan Vision Cabernet Sauvignon over-delivers for its price point. The fruit expression is bold and ripe, with intense raspberry and blackberry liqueur scents followed by tangy cherry pie filling in the mouth. Ends up on a lingering mocha note. Drink now to 2011.",Nugan Family Estates 2008 Vision Cabernet Sauvignon (Riverina)
"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot. Juicy berry flavors are forward but not overly evolved or complex, and the the finish is tight and aggressive. Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",O. Fournier 2008 Urban Ribera  (Ribera del Duero)
"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.",Pago de la Jaraba 2007 Azagador Viñedos Propios Crianza Red (La Mancha)
"Going for structure as much as fruit, this is a cool wine with black currant flavors giving high acidity. It feels light, fresh, although there are tannins and spice to give some final weight.",Adega Cooperativa do Cartaxo 2007 Bridão Classico Red (Ribatejo)
"Opens with a blast of cola and minty grass, and then comes a raisiny wave and mossy herbal notes that are typical of Navarran Merlot, which makes up 60% of this three-grape blend. Gritty in the mouth, with black cherry, licorice, herbs, raisin and lasting sweetness on the finish.",Alzania 2004 Finca la Moneda Red (Navarra)
"Simple juicy fruit, just touched by tannins, but more driven by ripe plum juice and the brightest, delicious acidity.",Barton & Guestier 2008  Beaujolais-Villages
"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice. Finishes solid and warm, with enough vitality and juiciness to maintain balance. More or less what you want from affordable Monastrell.",Bodegas Bleda 2008 Castillo de Jumilla Monastrell (Jumilla)
"This concentrated, almost syrupy Malbec smells mossy and mulchy while also displaying scents of coffee grinds, tree bark and blackberry jam. A bolt of tartaric acidity keeps it from being flabby, while flavors of blackberry and black currant are salty, woody and finish resiny. Drink through 2020.",Matias Riccitelli 2012 Vineyard Selection Malbec (Mendoza)
"A rare 100% Petit Verdot, this is dense in red and black fruit, from plum and blueberry to blackberry, ripe enough to be in a cobbler. Cinnamon dusts the top, with a puff of smoke in the background. Balanced despite its heft, it finishes soft, ready to be paired with meaty foods.",McGah Family 2012 Scarlett Estate Grown Petit Verdot (Rutherford)
"This youthful, full-bodied red is restrained but slowly reveals aromas and flavors of crushed violet, bright red berry, baking spice and tobacco. The tannins are tightly packed so give it a few years to unwind. Drink 2018–2025.",Michele Chiarlo 2012 Asili  (Barbaresco)
"From limestone and granite soils, this is a structured, mineral, textured wine. It already has a fine balance between berry fruits and their acidity and a dense, dry tannic core that gives the wine a solid character and considerable potential. Drink from 2018.",Monte da Ravasqueira 2013 Red (Alentejano)
"Made in a complex style rather than simply fruity, this smells like toasted almonds and vanilla bean. Tastes suggest not-quite-sweet Bosc pears, butter and walnuts. While the texture is luxurious the body is actually light, and the wine is not at all cloying.",Naggiar 2014 Estate Viognier (Sierra Foothills)
"A savory blend of 40% Sangiovese, 30% Monica and 30% Carignano, this vibrant red offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, tilled soil, leather, cooking spice, carob and violet. The chewy palate delivers ripe black cherry, juicy blackberry, ground clove and dried Mediterranean herb alongside round, enveloping tannins that give it a velvety texture.",Pala 2014 Silenzi Red (Isola dei Nuraghi)
"Fragrant and structured, this opens with aromas of perfumed berry, rose petal and spice. The tightly woven palate offers ripe red cherry, crushed strawberry and grilled herb alongside tightly packed tannins and brisk acidity.",Pasquale Pelissero 2012 Bricco San Giuliano  (Barbaresco)
"Scorched earth, black-skinned berry, orange zest and baking spice are some of the aromas that emerge on this vibrant red. It's still nervous, offering flavors of raw red berry, white pepper and grilled herb alongside bracing tannins. A coffee note signals the close. Drink 2018–2026.",Piazzo Armando 2010 Nervo Vigna Giaia Riserva  (Barbaresco)
"Another big, dense expression of the vintage, this has a softness to the tannins that makes it accessible, though the wine will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2017. Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco.",Provenance Vineyards 2012 Barrel Select Cabernet Sauvignon (Rutherford)
"Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Saperavi and 5% Rara Neagra, this wine has a nose of leather, cherry, black raspberry, fig and black plum. Flavors of fresh fig, spice and black plum slowly dissipate on the enduring finish.",Purcari 2010 Negru de Purcari Red (Moldova)
"Crafted from 50% Chardonnay, 45% Pinot Gris and 5% Pinot Blanc, this straw-colored wine offers aromas of lemongrass and almond blossom. It is balanced in the mouth, with flavors of tropical fruit, pineapple and understated flowers.",Purcari 2012 Alb de Purcari White (Moldova)

"This Alvarinho comes from vines grown outside the classic Vinho Verde appellation in the larger Minhao region of northern Portugal, but you'd never know it. It has all the intensity and richness of the grape, with a rich texture and apricot and pineapple flavors. It's a fine wine that could age, so drink from 2016.",Quinta de Lourosa 2014 Alvarinho (Minho)
"This unique wine offers light aromas of white pepper, bay leaf, coffee and dried leaves. The cherry flavors are elegant with a creamy feel and a tart finish, seeming a big compact at present but developing over time.",Rasa 2013 Vox Poluli Mourvèdre (Walla Walla Valley (OR))

"One of the winery's special block bottlings, this shows purple aromas of blackberry, violet and lilac alongside graphite and toasted oak. The palate is meaty, bitter and spice-driven, without much overt fruit, showing anise, pencil shavings, tar and concentrated cranberry skins.",Riverbench 2013 Mesa Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Tingling acidity wraps around a core of pear and peach fruit in this well-integrated, layered and lush wine. The oak is quiet through the entry and midpalate, picking up power and weight on the finish. Lovely on its own, it's also a good choice for the table.",Roth 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley)
"Powerful black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors seem to infuse this full-bodied wine with lots of fruit energy. It tastes vivid and unique because of that deep vein of black fruit impressions, and stays balanced by firm acidity and fine-grained tannins in spite of its alcoholic strength.",Saxon Brown 2010 Fighting Brothers Cuvée Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley)
"Vivid aromas of tart cherry and cranberry are followed by equally vivid, crisp and tangy flavors that echo the cherry and cranberry but add richer plum notes and nuances of cinnamon, nutmeg and cedar. This is so well balanced and bright that it tastes lip-smacking delicious now but will improve with age through at least 2020.",Steven Kent 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley)

"This soft, subdued wine is pervasive in barbecue smoke, black licorice and toasted marshmallow. It's made from mostly Zinfandel, with smaller pockets of Petite Sirah and Carignane. Intense, especially toward the finish, it finds a thread of acidity in the background to lift itself up.",Valdez 2012 Zinfandel (Sonoma County)

"Produced from the vines that surround the family house at Quinta da Aveleda, this is an exemplary Vinho Verde. Dry and crisp, with richness as well as freshness, it is a bright, tight and lightly mineral wine to drink now.",Aveleda 2014 Quinta da Aveleda Estate Bottled White (Vinho Verde)

"This blend of 76% Sta. Rita Hills and 24% Russian River Valley fruit plays to the denser side of the grape, with black cherry and nutmeg aromas most prevalent.

This feels chunky and a bit heavy and creamy, with chocolaty oak dominating the flavor profile along with medicinal berry notes. An herbal tasting choppy finish is saturated.",Altocedro 2015 Año Cero Cabernet Sauvignon (La Consulta)
"Pinot Noir is something winemaker Anthony Nappa makes only in rare vintages. This intensely earthy expression offers slightly muted tones of red currant and cranberry accented by dusty minerals, cedar and dried oregano. It's a sharp slightly peppery wine with firm persistent tannins on the finish.",Anthony Nappa 2014 Nemesis Pinot Noir (North Fork of Long Island)
"Aromas of ripe green apple, pear, Spanish broom and tangerine lead to a creamy palate of yellow stone fruit and a hint of white almond. Fresh acidity and a mineral note brighten the finish.",Balestri Valda 2015  Soave Classico
"Shy aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, espresso and a whiff of dark spice emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and grilled sage alongside fresh acidity and taut tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2019.",Banfi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino
"Medium-intense scents of honeydew, baked apple, peach pit and dried wildflowers are direct and forward on the nose, while flavors of citrus and melon fill the smooth but not flabby palate. Solid acidity lifts the mouthfeel and lends freshness through the finish, which is otherwise full of rich notes of apple pie, honeycomb and orange marmalade. Drink now.",Bellingham 2015 The Old Orchards Chenin Blanc (Paarl)
"Delicate swathes of honey brighten savory chestnut, smoke and mineral tones throughout this feather-light dry Riesling. It's an earthier slightly darker expression of Riesling with electric acidity accenting hints of spice and dusty pollen. The finish is long and intently smoky.",Bellwether 2014 Sawmill Creek Vineyard Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes)
"Initial aromas of jammy black fruits and cardamom yield to cheesy oak as this airs out. A plump wide palate is blocky, while gamy notes of animal hide, cassis, plum and oak form the flavor profile. A lingering exotic taste of blueberry centers a mild finish.",Bressia 2014 Monteagrelo Syrah (Mendoza)
"White spring flower and apple aromas lead the way on this enjoyable white. The soft fresh palate doles out ripe Bartlett pear, citrus and a hint of mineral that lifts the finish.",Cantina Produttori San Michele Appiano 2015 Pinot Grigio (Alto Adige)
"This wine has offers aromas of dark plum and chocolate. It is inky garnet in the glass, with flavors of cherry, cranberry, cured meat, thyme and sage. Stealthy tannins appear as if from nowhere just before a bright finish that is punctuated by a touch of smoke.",Carmel 2013 Admon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee)
"Dried berry, leather, cola, and herb notes show on the nose of this bottling from the mountains between the Conejo Valley and Malibu Coast. The flavors are savory at first—all crushed anise and mint—but grow fruitier as it opens, suggesting dark strawberry, blueberry, vanilla and clove. Quite quaffable.",Cielo 2012 Malibu Estate Syrah (Saddle Rock-Malibu)
"This wine has a clean nose of grapefruit with a hint of violet. Flavors of apricot and lemon take a backseat to a strong vein of lavender. Soft on entry, it has good mouthfeel and a nice pink grapefruit splash on the finish.",Recanati 2014 Chardonnay (Upper Galilee)
"Fermented in new barrels, this is a ripe, yellow fruit- and spice-flavored wine. It blends Fernão Pires, Roupeiro and Arinto, resulting in rich fruit, bright acidity and a fine, toasty character. Ready to drink.",Roquevale 2014 Reserva Branco White (Alentejo)
"This orange-style wine has a cloudy yellow-gold appearance because it spent 30 days on the skins and 100 days on the lees. It has aromas and flavors of aged apple cider and tart apple pie with an astringent finish. This style is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate orange wine made from Chardonnay, this is a solid example.",Ross-idi 2015 Orange Nikolaevo Vineyard Chardonnay
"Aromas of raisin and cooked black fruits are malty. This high-alcohol Malbec feels hard, tannic and collapsed. Stewy nutty flavors of blackberry and prune come with a dash of salt, while this shows raisiny flavors and dry tannins on a heavy finish.",San Pedro de Yacochuya 2008 Malbec (Cafayate)
"Pretty orange blossom notes morph into zesty white grapefruit and lime in this exceptionally light off-dry Riesling. It's delicately concentrated on the palate but offers loads of invigorating, waterfall-like refreshment.",Silver Thread 2015 Doyle Fournier Vineyard Riesling (Seneca Lake)

"Forest floor, new leather, pressed violet, ripe berry, Mediterranean herb and eucalyptus aromas lead the way on this robust red. The densely concentrated palate shows raisin, vanilla, prune and espresso alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. Chewy tannins provide support while a hint of licorice wraps up the finish. Give it a few years to unwind, then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.",Tassi 2012  Brunello di Montalcino

"Fynbos and lime leaf aromas are front and center on the nose of this wine, but are grounded by fruity tones of tart gooseberry and plum.

Drink now.",Tokara 2015 Sauvignon Blanc (Western Cape)

"Initial pronounced smoke and struck match aromas blow off with aeration, revealing fresher green apple and lime notes. As it opens, lip-smacking hits of honey and sweet tangerine come to the fore. Drink now through 2020.",Bollig-Lehnert 2015 Trittenheimer Apotheke Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Relatively restrained for Viognier, with attractive fruit notes of muskmelon, apricot and pineapple, but not much more in the way of complexity. It's medium bodied, with a long, refreshing finish that hints at white pepper. Drink now.",Alain Jaume et Fils 2015 Domiane Grand Veneur Blanc de Viognier (Côtes du Rhône)
This wine is made from 100% Furmint and has an intriguing bouquet of jasmine and lemon blossom. It is crisp and acidic on the palate with pleasant flavors of lemon zest and lime juice.,Kikelet 2015 Furmint (Tokaj)
"This wine is well balanced and solidly constructed, wrapping its ripe blackberry and dark plum flavors in firm tannins. Light oak spice, vanilla and cinnamon touches are the icing on the cake.",LangeTwins 2013 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi)
"This monopole (wholly-owned vineyard) is in the heart of the village of Aloxe-Corton. The 2005 is structured and wood-dominated at this stage; the dense fruit and the sweet, ripe, red berry acidity are waiting to develop into a wine that will be rich, smooth and velvety. Give it 6 years at least.",Corton André 2005 Le Château  (Aloxe-Corton)
"Adrianna sits at 5,000 feet, making it one of the highest vineyards in all of Mendoza. The wine shows pure Tupungato mountain fruit, with deep chocolaty undertones and lots of fine, toasty French oak. For deep berry flavors and smoothness more than rough and tough, Adrianna is on the money. Drink now through 2011.",Bodega Catena Zapata 2004 Catena Adrianna Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley)
"A studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak. Much of this wine is fermented in plastic bins (not tanks), and the affiliated intensity grabs your attention. The blackberry flavors are potent and backed by heavy chocolate and toast. Lots of mouthfeel and power, with tannic grab. This wine can age several more years.",Bodega Catena Zapata 2004 Catena Nicasia Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley)
"The fruit bursts out of the glass, while the supporting tannins give power and intensity to this concentrated wine. It has all the richness of 2005, backed with juicy red fruits and some vibrant acidity. Age this wine, although its generous character means you could drink it in 5 years. Not available in the U.S.",Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005  Echézeaux
"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.",Adastra 2004 Merlot (Carneros)
"This dark, brooding wine shows many of the qualities of this great vineyard, just across the road from Romanée-Conti. The dense tannins dominate, but the rich black cherry fruit is their equal, creating structure. A wine to savor over many years.",Domaine François Lamarche 2005  La Grande Rue
"This is an exotic, flashy wine, marked by layers of ripe, sweet tropical fruit. Honey, peaches and mangoes are plump and mouthfilling, but end with elegance and finesse, making for a finely balanced wine worthy of the two-star accolade.",Schmitges 2006 Erdener Treppchen Spätlese** Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"A very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a mélange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years.",Joseph Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
"Vall Llach Embruix may be the winery's base-level offering but it's no starter wine. Five grapes led by Garnacha are blended to achieve a potent and piercing brew of blueberry aromas, black cherry and cassis flavors, and a rich, chocolaty finish. Modern in style, and making no apologies for it. Equal in quality to the excellent 2004 Embruix.",Vall Llach 2005 Embruix Red (Priorat)
"Wines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness. Maybe complexity is edged out by all this juicy fruit, but the tannins do firm up the wine, which should certainly age 10 years or more.",Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2005  Clos de la Roche
"Big, burly Pinot Noir, dominated by black cherries, rich fruit and firm tannins. This is wine that shows richness, with a smoky, chewy structure and great spice and aromatic perfumes. The juiciness comes through on the finish, but never leaves the structure behind.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2005  Gevrey-Chambertin
"The aroma is a perfume shop. Even on the palate, although the rich botrytis character is prevalent, there is a wonderful, exotic, Asian intensity of flavor. The acidity and honey are welcome and balanced.",Bründlmayer 2006 Beerenauslese Gelber Muskateller (Kamptal)
"Powerful and dense, this shows structured, ripe and concentrated black plum and dark cherry flavors. It has dense, firm tannins, which look likely to dominate the wine for many years, leaving a strong, dry aftertaste.",Domaine François Lamarche 2005 Clos de Vougeot  (Clos de Vougeot)
"Rich, viscous and sweet, this is a spätlese that punches above its weight. A bit of dried apricot hints at the inclusion of some botrytized grapes, while the rest of the fruit shows superripe flavors of peaches and honey. This is long on the finish, clinging to the palate. Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",Kurt Hain 2006 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Big-format Malbec is what we're calling this new 15.5% wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault, original partners in Michel Rolland's Clos de los Siete project. Round, lush and full of body, Flechas shows muscle but little fat. It's colorful, dark, full of black fruit and long on the finish. It is modern Malbec done for modern palates.",Flechas de los Andes 2006 Gran Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now.",Bodega Catena Zapata 2005 Catena Alta Chardonnay (Mendoza)
"This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5–7 years' aging.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Beaune du Château Premier Cru  (Beaune)
"For a Savigny, this is surprisingly firm and tannic, the wine's structure an impressive edifice of dry tannins and firm cranberry and plum skin flavors. It is certainly ripe, the fruit promising attractive richness in 3–5 years, followed by good aging potential.",Bouchard Père & Fils 2005 Les Lavières Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins. The acidity is there, but it is the generosity of the fruit that is most obvious, going right through the wine to the sweet, jammy finish.",Domaine de la Vougeraie 2005 Les Cras Premier Cru  (Vougeot)
"This is a rather big and burly wine for a Mosel spätlese, weighing in at 11.5% alcohol. And while it shows plenty of power, it also shows nuance in its aromas and flavors, which range from baked fruit, honey and spiced marmalade to oily, mineral essences. Has the concentration to age, but the balance of sugar and alcohol may not hold in the long run—drink it over the next few years to avoid disappointment.",Dr. H. Thanisch (Erben Müller-Burggraef) 2006 Bernkasteler Graben Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"When Dry Creek gets it right, few wineries anywhere can beat their Zins. Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun. The wine is impressive in ripe blackberries, currants, licorice and cocoa, but maintains a beautiful structure, with soft, fine tannins and just-in-time acidity.",Dry Creek Vineyard 2005 Somers Ranch Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette—a mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.",JLC 2004 Spofford Station Estate Merlot (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"Soft and seductive, this coffee-laced Cab Franc perfectly captures the dark aromas and crisply defined fruit of the grape. There's just a splash of DuBrul Merlot in the blend to add some buoyancy; but the Franc dominates. It's a cool-climate style, firm and tart, with natural acids and a lovely coffee and smoke streak running through polished tannins. Brilliant winemaking.",Owen Roe 2006 Rosa Mystica Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb—a delicious mélange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages. It's masterful winemaking in a package so young and wrapped up tight that it may pass you by if you don't give it a good look.",Woodward Canyon 2005 Artist Series #14 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished. The fruit mixes ripe berries and moves smoothly into flavors of earth, smoke, tobacco and graphite.",Forgeron 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The Rust style of ultra-sweet wine is all about wonderful honey and toffee flavors over intense acidity, a great balancing act of spice, dry botrytis and great sweetness. This wine is both fresh and complex, a bottle that needs at least 5 years to age. Screwcap.",Gunter Triebaumer 2005 Ruster Ausbruch Welschriesling (Burgenland)
"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009–2012.",Achaval-Ferrer 2006 Finca Altamira Malbec (La Consulta)
"A wine that is on the cusp of adding an extra element of complexity. At present, there is deliciously perfumed fruit, white and green currants and white peaches, with a definite citrus edge. The bonus is the taut texture, which is closing in and lifting the fruit, promising future aging. Screwcap.",Hirsch 2004 Gaisberg Riesling Riesling (Kamptal)
"Racy, lime-tinged acidity cuts a fine edge through this steely, intensely mineral kabinett. On the palate, pristine, honeyed sprays of lemon and tangerine lend a mouthwatering feel. The finish is long, accented by touches of pollen and spice.",Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Abtsberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Chalk and slate notes juxtapose fragrant, sweet-tart tangerine, lime and lemon on the nose and palate of this laser-edged kabinett. A kiss of honey gives the midpalate just a touch of sweetness that lingers long on the finish.",Maximin Grünhäuser 2014 Herrenberg Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"A wine that's had some time to find itself in bottle, this opens in a wildness of mountain tannin and dusty texture, grippy and dry on the palate. Cedar, tobacco and shy black fruit call out for braised red meat, with a structure that should hold up longer in the cellar if necessary.",Mueller Family Vineyards 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)
"A lush and expansive, small-production wine, this weaves together dark fruit with streaks of cedar and herb, its texture fleshy, full bodied and powerful. The tannin and oak are nicely integrated, allowing for a balance of structure and flavor.",Herencia 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)
"Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) makes this cuvée for Le Cadeau, and it's a triumph in this vintage. Cherry fruit ripe to the point of syrup hogs the flavor spotlight, but there's cranberry and raspberry too, putting a tangy note into the mix. Root beer and sweet cola elements combine, and there is little doubt that, good as it is already, this is a wine to cellar. Drink now–2028.",Le Cadeau 2014 Diversité Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Elegantly floral and classic in dried herb, cedar, black pepper and pencil lead, this wine offers complex components of flavor and intrigue around velvety black fruit and a long, grippy finish. It impresses in its ability to be both approachable and timeless.",Levendi 2012 Sweetwater Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak)
"Graphite, rose petals, vanilla and a strong yet not over-exuberant black cherry quality pump up the nose of this decadent bottling by Brian Loring. There's great tactile texture once sipped, with chalky tannins unveiling ripe cranberry, red cherry, clay, cinnamon and baking-spice elements.",Loring Wine Company 2014 Rancho La Vina Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"This wood-aged wine is a product of the new venture Sogrape has launched in Alentejo. It is powerful, dark in color and seriously concentrated. Dense tannins and a solid structure are rich with black plum and berry fruits as well as acidity. The wine is still young and needs to age. Drink from 2018.",Sogrape 2013 Herdade do Peso Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"Long barrel-aging of many old native varieties gives this field blend a rich, ripe taste. There is an attractive touch of oxidation from the wood, giving concentrated toast and spice as well as fruit acidity. This unusual, impressive wine from the Guedes family is ready to drink now.",Sogrape NV Branco Especial White (Dão)
"From Montemaggiore Vineyard on the western hills of the appellation, and containing 5% Viognier, this is a well-made wine, nicely rustic in a dirty, rowdy mix of black pepper and earth. Dense, thick layers of cocoa play with floral notes of lavender and rose, finishing softly. This will age well through 2023.",Spicy Vines 2013 Dragon's Kiss Syrah (Dry Creek Valley)
"Lush candied fruits abound in this naturally botrytised wine. With 147 g/L of residual sugar, it still reaches over 12% alcohol. Pineapple, lemon and orange peel, pine resin, honey, cedar and butterscotch are all in the mix, plus a lot more. You can go spelunking in this wine and never see it all.",Territorial 2013 Equinox Vineyard Spoiled Rotten Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)
"With light touches of wood aging, this delicate, honeyed wine has all the poise and style of Jurançon, in the foothills of the Pyrénées mountains. Lightly stepping between freshness and rich, ripe, sweet fruitiness, the wine is full of apricot, sweet apple and lime acidity. It is delicious, but it would be a shame for the taste Sébastien and Isabelle Bordenave-Coustarret created not to age it, so drink from 2019.",Domaine Coustarret 2012 Le Barou  (Jurançon)
"From the winery's dry-farmed vineyard comes this bottling with seamlessly integrated aromas of boysenberry, black-pepper sauce and black sesame. A tarry character kicks off the palate and then evolves into roasted lamb with lavender-pepper crust, dried mint and tarragon flavors. A soft and deftly sewn acidity hums throughout the sip.",Foxen 2013 Tinaquaic Vineyard Syrah (Santa Maria Valley)
"Cranberry, dried sage, sour cherry, thyme and dried chaparral shrubbery show on the nose of this wine from an oceanview vineyard near Ben Lomond. The palate is fairly lithe and bouncy with acidity, showing lots of crushed bay leaf and wild sage as well as underripe strawberry and richer cranberry notes.",Big Basin 2013 Coast Grade Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"A damp herbal character shows first on the nose of this wine, with wet sage and marjoram spicing up the stewed cranberry fruit. The action explodes once sipped, with black cherry and mulberry giving backbone to the cardamom and other Indian-spice components. It combines richness and energy.",Boekenoogen 2013 Estate Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
This super-rich wood-aged wine is ripe with tropical fruits and packed with toast flavors. It is already mature with an attractive oxidative edge from the new barrels that adds complexity to the fruitiness. It is impressive—maybe too powerful—but certainly a serious expression of what the Douro can do with white wines. Drink now.,Casa Ferreirinha 2012 Antónia Adelaide Ferreira White (Douro)
"It will be interesting to see if the release of this luxury-level Shiraz (the second vintage) has any impact on the perception of Casella's other brands: Yellow Tail and Peter Lehmann. Even at nine years of age, this is impressively dark and intense, with minty notes, cedar and vanilla and meaty, umami-like flavors that linger on the long, silky finish. Drink now.",Casella 2007 1919 Shiraz (Wrattonbully)
"A new wine for Alain Dominique Perrin's Lagrézette, this comes from a single vineyard on mainly gravel soil. It is dark, dense and powerfully concentrated. The dry tannins with their edge of minerality still dominate the black plum and berry flavors. Along with power and depth, the wine has its elegant side with the acidity giving a lift and even freshness at the end.",Château Lagrézette 2013 Paragon Terroir de Massaut Malbec (Cahors)
"Heady, gamy and thick notes of lanolin, blood, lamb, smoked wood, roasted fennel, pencil lead and peppercorn rise into intriguing coriander and cumin notes on the nose of this blend of 52% Grenache, 26% Syrah and 22% Mourvèdre. Those exotic spice notes carry to the palate, where a medium acidity and clean tannic structure present black peppercorn and cardamom notes atop a boysenberry backdrop.",Alta Colina 2012 Estate G-S-M (Paso Robles)
"Irresistably juicy and fruity, yet so delicately nuanced by spice, earth and mineral, this light-footed kabinett encapsulates much of what's so special about Mosel Riesling. The palate bursts with rich yellow peach and mango, but nervous lemon-lime acidity lends an electric vibe. It's delicious now but should improve through 2021.",Fritz Haag 2014 Brauneberger Kabinett Riesling (Mosel)
"Vanilla, citrus and white flowers on the nose lead this memorable white from mainland Greece. The overall character is linear and crisp, with lemon and limestone flavors interlaced with exotic fruits and rose. A wine with class and character that will offer diverse food pairing experiences.",Dionysos 2014 Moschofilero (Mantinia)
"This wood-aged, perfumed wine is serious, complex and will take its time to develop. It is full of dark tannins and ripe black fruits, laced with acidity. It comes from old vines, planted in the 1970s, which give great concentration and depth to the wine. It will be ready to drink from 2019.",Domaine de Cause 2013 La Lande Cavagnac Malbec (Cahors)
"A lightly colored, earthy and yet intense and powerful wine, this comes from a tremendous vineyard site along Westside Road. Pretty roses and cups of black tea are evoked on the entry before supple, well-built layers of lush, juicy cranberry, pomegranate and tangy cherry come into focus, finishing complex and rich.",Gary Farrell 2013 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)
"Light in color and ethereally earthy, this wine opens with delicate notes of rose petal and allspice. It then broadens into a gorgeous, medium-weight and mouthfilling sensation of red fruit and more spice, which lingers long on the finish.",Artesa 2013 Single Vineyard Sangiacomo Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros)
"Forest floor, new leather, ripe, dark-skinned berry and hint of blue flower are some of the scents you'll discover on this structured, polished red. The smooth, delicious palate offers layers of fleshy black cherry, baking spice and dried Mediterranean herb while firm, refined tannins provide the framework.",Badia a Coltibuono 2011 Riserva  (Chianti Classico)

It's solidly balanced, not at all shy about oak flavors and engagingly complex. Drink now through 2020.",Black Kite 2013 River Turn Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)
"The wine comes from the Guedes family's showpiece estate for Casa Ferreirinha in the Alto Douro. It is dark, dense and still very young. With a strong mineral element and dry tannins, it has concentration as well as potential. The black plum fruits are still developing, still youthful. So give this impressive wine until 2020 before drinking.",Casa Ferreirinha 2013 Quinta da Leda Red (Douro)
"Dense and chewy at first, this deliciously brooding wine is all about black licorice, berry and meat. Contoured layers of integrated tannin give it an understated elegance and sense of class despite its wild power and body.",Joseph Swan Vineyards 2010 Great Oak Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)
"Nice concentration and pretty aromas characterize this brawny red: red fruit, forest berries, licorice, mineral tones, toasted nut and black slate are identifying elements. There's good ripeness and succulence to the wine followed by solid tannins.",Talamonti 2004 Tre Saggi  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo)
"This lively, 100% Sauvignon Blanc sports fresh flavors of grapefruit, lemon meringue and quinine—much like a cool-climate Viognier. Racy and fresh, it was mostly stainless-steel fermented, and is young enough to capture a bit of spritz in the mouthfeel.",Woodinville Wine Cellars 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Thick concentration and extraction set the tone for what proves to be a meaty, raw, chunky wine with chewy succulence and a creamy texture. Not much is subtle especially the blockbuster nose, which is redolent of smoked ham, beef jerky, black fruit and spicy barbecue sauce.",Brunelli 2001 Campo del Tìtari  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)
"This is one of the producer's top wines and its quality is immediately confirmed thanks to well-integrated notes of melon, honey, peach, citrus and exotic fruit. It has vibrant crispness on the close.",Fazi Battaglia 2004 Massaccio  (Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico Superiore)
"Pristine and luminous in appearance, this typical northern Italian Sauvignon Blanc is clear and clean with enticing aromas of exotic fruit, peach and kiwi. Peach flavors flood the mouth and are cut clean by zesty acidity on the finish.",Cantina Terlano 2006 Winkl Sauvignon (Alto Adige)
"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",Chateau Ste. Michelle 2005 Cold Creek Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))
"Lively white fruit with a mineral edge. The flavors are just showing some signs of mature toast, but at the moment green, crisp tastes predominate. The sweet dosage —relatively high—seems to need time to integrate.",Nicolas Feuillatte 1998 Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"Dark, dense concentration sets this Conero apart from the crowd as do the penetrating notes of red fruit, plum, beets, leather and tobacco. The wine delivers structure, power and would be best paired with grilled meat.",Conti Leopardi di San Leopardo 2004 Vigneti del Coppo  (Rosso Conero)
"Cassis and chocolate notes dominate, but there's enough minty, eucalypt character to impart complexity, all framed by some firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long and mouthwatering; drink now–2015. Multiple U.S. importers.",Hugh Hamilton 2005 The Villain Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)
"Honeyed apricot and orange peel on the nose and palate typify this elegant but playful botrytis wine. The wine's lively acidity gives it a bounce on the tongue, adding dimension to the citrus components and lending it more to food pairing with desserts or a cheese plate.",Royal Tokaji 2003 Aszú 5 Puttonyos  (Tokaji)
"Not as rich or chewy as the Diamond Mountain Ranch bottling, Sterling's 2004 Reserve Cabernet is immediately accessible, offering aromas and flavors of cassis and dried spices and soft tannins. A good steak house red.",Sterling 2004 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)

"Plenty of deep color, thick tannin and dark streaks of smoke and tar make this a stand-up steakhouse wine. The fruit does have an herbal edge but it is lingering, complex and interesting. Think of it as the vinous equivalent of a cello-viola sonata—dark and mysteriously intertwined.",Woodinville Wine Cellars 2004 O.M.O. Red (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The nice thing is how this wine delivers so much fruit, especially peach, apricot and mature pear. The mouthfeel is creamy and sophisticated but the overall emphasis is on the purity and intensity of the fruit fragrances. Grapes are harvested late, at the end of October, for extra flavor.",Velenosi 2005 Vigna Solaria White (Falerio)
"Cavit's Bottega Vinaia line offers an extremely likeable and creamy wine that will more than satisfy adoring fans of Italian Pinot Grigio.

"Soft, ripe and thick, this is one of those Rhône-style Pinots that purists will find on the big side for a variety that's supposed to be silky and delicate.

"This is a supersmooth, easy-going wine with mild dark-fruit flavors, very little tannin and a soft texture. Two years aging in previously used oak barrels helped round off any corners in the mouthfeel.",Scotto Family Cellars 2013 Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi)

"This combines 73% Grenache, 16% Syrah and 11% Mourvèdre from Stone Tree, Arianses, Ciel du Cheval and Heart of the Hill vineyards. Its vanilla, pencil box, green herb, raspberry and purple fruit aromas are followed by quite sweet, ripe, full-bodied red and black fruit flavors. The balance seems off.",:Nota Bene 2013 Una Notte Red (Columbia Valley (WA))

"This blends cool-climate Syrah (50%) from the Edna Valley with warmer-site Petite Sirah (45%) and Grenache (5%) and shows candied cinnamon, black cherry, plum and cedar aromas.

A unique, refreshing and memorable wine.",Roark Wine Co. 2014 Sanford & Benedict Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)
"Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018–2035.",Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace)
"Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025–2050.",Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A touch of lemon balm adds a breezy freshness to the nose, while a pure, bright and precise notion of ripe lemon pervades and takes over the entire palate.

Drink 2017–2037.",Domaines Schlumberger 2014 Saering Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017–2040 at least.",Domaine Schoffit 2015 Clos Saint-Théobald Rangen Grand Cru Vendanges Tardives Riesling (Alsace)
"Glorious and utterly enticing notes of peach hover on the nose. They are joined by a tart, aromatic citrus tang of bergamot and citrus foliage. The palate has that same alluring aromatic spectrum that unites utter freshness with exoticism. This seems light but also packs an incredible punch. There is energy and verve on the midpalate, which has an utterly compact, concentrated but fluid texture. Bright zestiness illuminates the entire palate. It's a most unusual and most beguiling Riesling with incredible appeal and potential. Drink 2017–2040.",Julien Schaal 2016 Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"There is a glorious touch of ripe peach among the abundant lemon notes of the nose. A hint of grapefruit spice lends added allure. These notes carry to the palate that is juicy in ripe peach, grapefruit and bright lemon. All this happens on an completely dry, finely delineated body of absolute precision and poise. There is something crystalline about this, something fine-boned and delicate that nonetheless has absolute power to convince. This is simply wonderful. Its inherent grace will only increase with time. Drink 2020–2037.",Kuentz-Bas 2015 Geisberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs—think chervil and yarrow—also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022–2040.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2014 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020–2040.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"Chamomile and ripe, red-apple notes make for an appetizing nose. The palate adds lovely vivid notes of zesty tangerine to this.

The dry long finish has a grounding earthy touch. Simply wonderful. Drink 2017–2035.",Julien Schaal 2016 Kastelberg Grand Cru Schiste Riesling (Alsace)
"This beautiful wine, with its poise, elegance and balance, has both a steely mineral core and an outer ripe-fruit character. It has citrus, tight acidity and rich apple and green-plum flavors. The wine is still a little young and will be better from 2019.",Louis Roederer 2012 Vintage Brut  (Champagne)
"Touches of vanilla, cream and lovely hints of oatmeal allude to developing, evolving autolytic notes. These are edged with pure lemon, giving equal expression to emollience and freshness. On the midpalate the creamy, generous richness of yeast comes through, providing stucture and a canvas against which tart apple and Amalfi lemon can play. Depth and serious intent shows amid the sensuously fine fizz. Although this wine is refreshing and bright now, more bottle age will make it even more alluring. The pure and lasting finish leaves you wanting more. Drink 2017–2017.",Nyetimber 2010 Blanc de Blancs Chardonnay (England)
"Extremely dark in color and nearly opaque, this bottling shows dried violet, lilac and lavender scents, along with a charred black currant essence that's rich but not sweet. Prominent acidity and soft but structured tannins present roasted black fruit and baking spice flavors. Drink 2019–2030.",Paix Sur Terre 2015 The Golden Road Yankowski Weeks Vineyard Monastrell
"Perfectly baked red cherry aromas are dusted with cola, slate, olive, sumac and Middle Eastern spice on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. The palate expertly balances tight tannins, bright acidity and a vibrant energy to deliver tart raspberry, thyme, forest floor and roast beef flavors that sail into the zingy finish.",Chanin 2015 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)
"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond.",De Toren 2014 Book 17 XVII Red (Stellenbosch)
"A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017–2035.",Domaine Ostertag 2015 A360P Muenchberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)
"A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017–2037.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Clos Saint Urbain Rangen de Thann Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"A flinty touch of promising reduction still hovers on the nose but cheeky floral and fruity hints of honeysuckle, jasmine and peach shimmer through. The palate unites all of these aromatic notions on a textured, layered and concentrated palate. The hints of honeysuckle spice are intensified by the ripe zestiness of Amalfi lemon and tangerine. The finish is dry and long, with ample refreshment from these gorgeous citrus notes. This is glorious now in its youthful exuberance but has the concentration, structure and fruit to age beautifully. Drink 2017–2035.",Domaine Zind-Humbrecht 2015 Goldert Grand Cru Muscat (Alsace)
"Aged in a combination of concrete egg, stainless steel and new French oak, this winning white is a study in peach and apricot—it's incredibly inviting in both taste and aroma. A layer of honey adds succulence without sweetness, as it remains dry and balanced through the mineral-laden finish.",Galerie 2016 Terracea Riesling (Spring Mountain District)
"Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length. There is an elegant touch that makes this all the more seductive, especially on the tingling zesty finish. A total joy. Drink 2017–2030.",Jean-Baptiste Adam 2015 Kaefferkopf Grand Cru Vieilles Vignes Riesling (Alsace)
"The nose opens with a concentrated hit of ripe clementine peel, underneath this notions of mirabelle and pear shimmer. The palate is concentrated and full but appears much lighter—a combination of fresh acidity and an alluring touch of residual sweetness do their best to add a spring to the step of this unusual but captivating wine. Scintillating hints of mandarin peel, honeysuckle and kumquat make this incredibly moreish. The finish is off dry to medium sweet. Lovely now, but it's sure to last. Try with cheeses or spicy Asian dishes. Drink 2017–2027.",Jean Biecher & Fils 2016 Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru White (Alsace)
"A wonderfully aromatic nose presents orange blossom and tangerine zest, Seville orange and ripe mandarin. All of these notions are joyously bundled on the concentrated dry palate that is brightened with even more zesty lemon freshness.

The absolutely dry finish is invigorating and lasting. Drink 2018–2035.",Julien Schaal 2016 Rosacker Grand Cru Calcaire Riesling (Alsace)
"Now just approaching maturity, this floral, aromatic wine is superb. Very dry, very crisp and with delicious lemon and green-apple freshness, the wine also has a strongly mineral character that comes from the chalk soil of the Côte des Blancs. The wine is just ready, although it will age further.",Lanson 2002 Noble Cuvée Blanc de Blancs Brut Chardonnay (Champagne)
"From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue.",Lynmar 2015 Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

"Just beginning to mature, this balanced, ripe wine is complex, with bright acidity, toast and pear and green-plum fruits. It is rich, with a tight mouse that shows intensity as well as a stylish character. This is a fine wine just coming into its own but well worth aging further until 2020.",Moët & Chandon 2008 Grand Vintage Brut  (Champagne)
"Wild strawberry and plum mix with subtle yet sultry notes of nutmeg, mace, loam, graphite and game on the nose of this bottling. Sizzling acidity leads the palate, carrying cherry, plum and red apple flavors, followed by layers of eucalyptus and pine forest.",Mount Eden Vineyards 2014 Estate Bottled Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)
"This wine comes alive on the expansive, fleshy palate of black pepper and olive tapenade flavors. It walks a fine line between tenacious structure and high-cheekboned fruit—a mélange of raspberry, cassis and blueberry compote. The aromas are enticing and reminiscent of violets. Though it can be enjoyed now, it will evolve well through 2034.",Nickel & Nickel 2014 State Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)
"What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017–2035.",Cave de Turckheim 2015 Brand Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace)
"This is perfumed with lovely violets and tight layers of mixed berries, currants and hints of truffle. It's young and muscular, with a pleasing chewy texture to the tannins. There is the sense that time will unfold the flavors and add nuances of herb and earth, capturing the varietal notes that can be   obliterated by over-ripe fruit and too much new oak.",Tamarack Cellars 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))
"A full-boat, five-varietal Bordeaux blend. It's nicely balanced, and retains some inviting aromas of violets and candied rose petals, leading into a lip-smacking, fruit-driven mid-palate with blueberries, boysenberries and a whisper of saffron and chocolate. There is plenty of acid underpinning, and a judicious use of barrels that keeps the fruit front and center. The best yet from Tildio.",Tildio 2005 Profundo Red Wine Red (Wahluke Slope)
"From a top subsection of McLaren Vale, this well-crafted Shiraz features a nice balance of sweet and savory notes. Ripe blackberry and plum flavors are matched by nuances of cedar, spice and meat. This creamy-textured Shiraz seems to be already approaching maturity; drink it now through 2012.",Joseph 2003 Angel Gully Shiraz (Clarendon)
"Broad in the mouth and rather burly, this nearly dry Riesling offers minerally, spice-driven aromas and flavors. A touch of honeyed richness on the palate rounds it out, but this is not a stereotypical fruity Riesling despite the mouthwatering finish.",Carl Ehrhard 2006 Rüdesheimer Kabinett Feinherb Riesling (Rheingau)
"The vineyard has championed Pinot Noir in this unlikely location in inland Mendocino County, and now De Loach successfully takes up the cause. Their '06 is gently soft, silky and dry, with deep flavors of cherries, currants, raspberries and chocolate, finished with a fine layer of oaky vanilla.",De Loach 2006 Masut Vineyard Pinot Noir (Redwood Valley)
"In really warm years like 2006, wines from the cool Saar valley often excel. This offering shows crisp, refreshing acidity to balance its residual sugar and classic flavors of green apple, lime and pineapple. Under it all is a firm foundation of slate-driven minerality and a fine, linear structure.",Dr. Fischer 2006 Ockfener Bockstein Spätlese Riesling (Mosel-Saar-Ruwer)
"Impressive for its minerality, this wine offers up aromas of petrol, honey and slate rather than the fruit-driven notes of many Rieslings. In the mouth, it's like drinking liquid rocks with just enough honey to help the minerals slide down smoothly, lingering sweetly on the finish.",Schumann-Nägler 2006 Johannisberger Erntebringer Kabinett Riesling (Rheingau)
"Almond blossom, stone fruit and a tiny touch of exotic spice or cracked white pepper shape the nose of this luminous, bright and very elegant sparkler. The wine has a creamy, sweet personality and offers loads of peach flavors on the finish. Particella 68 is a vineyard designate from the Vidor area of Proseccoland and the enologist employs special methods to maintain those fresh fragrances.",Sorelle Bronca NV Extra Dry Particella 68  (Prosecco di Valdobbiadene)
"A big, super-rich wine that concentrates on its vanilla and spice aspects, the fruit coming through as ripe quince and apricots flavored with pepper. The acidity is muted, appearing only at the end, to give a vibrant lift to this impressive wine. Glass stopper.",Steininger 2007 Grand Grü Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal)
"A rich, complex Pinot that shows the intricacies of Santa Lucia Pinot Noir yet retains an immediate drinkability for its silky fruit forwardness. Dry and crisp, the flavors of cherries, currants, cola, vanilla and smoky oak finish with a clean spiciness.",Tamayo Family 2006 Pinot Noir (Santa Lucia Highlands)
"A very taut, tight wine, crisp, green, perfumed. It has delicious white currants and hedgerow fruits, its delicacy and elegance balanced by its intensity of flavor. There is a definite herbal, mineral aftertaste. Screwcap.",Hirsch 2007 Zöbing Riesling (Kamptal)
"Kunde has nailed this price point for Syrah. It's rich and complex enough to put on the table beside a fine meal, and while it's not quite in the league of a cult Syrah, on the other hand it won't demand all the attention. Dry and finely tannic, it features flavors of blackberries, cherries, leather, mocha, tobacco, pepper and sage, and finishes long and spicy.",Kunde 2004 Syrah (Sonoma Valley)
A gentle wine with open and generous soft berry fruits showing through dusty tannins and lively acidity. This is likely to develop relatively fast into a delicious wine.,Louis Jadot 2005 La Dominode Premier Cru  (Savigny-lès-Beaune)
"Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.",Nicholas Cole Cellars 2005 Michele Red Wine Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))
"This is serious Blaufränkisch, a ripe, firmly structured wine that shows a dry edge of solid tannins before you get to the ripe, red fruits. There's power here, but it is finely integrated, and its fruity finish is well structured. Screwcap.",Gunter Triebaumer 2005 Reserve Blaufränkisch (Burgenland)
"So rich, so honeyed, with an oily texture, this Gewurz is simply wonderful. It shows powerfully ripe peach, pineapple, pear, honeysuckle, lemon cream and dusty spicebox flavors. With balancing acidity, it's California Gewurz at its most charming.",Handley 2006 Gewürztraminer (Anderson Valley)
"The Winkler-Hermaden family's vineyards drop precipitously down from Kapfenstein castle, which they run as a hotel. With their great exposure, the vineyards allow the Zweigelt in this wine to ripen well, giving richness and density of structure, with the rich spice and red stone fruits blanketed by dark tannins. Glass stopper.",Winkler-Hermaden 2005 Olivin Zweigelt (Südoststeiermark)
"Barrel aging for 12 months certainly renders this wine  round and rich. Juiciness combines with a severe, dry structure from the Cabernet to give a meaty ripe wine, surrounded with acidity, black fruits and a final soft, toasty character. Screwcap.",Gunter Triebaumer 2006 Blaufränkisch Cabernet Red (Burgenland)
"Ignore that misplaced accent over the ‘a' and focus on the excellent wine in the bottle. With Cabernet dominating., this wine is sleek and spicy, with a marked impression of graphite and gun metal. Although in general the '05 vintage is tilted more toward the ripe side of the spectrum, this wine retains a lean and elegant precision.",Camaraderie 2005 Elegánce Meek Vineyard Red Red (Yakima Valley)
"A richly fruity, tropical-fruit-scented Chardonnay that offers plenty of weight and fruit at a reasonable tariff. Bits of butter, dried spices and citrus accent the ripe fruit, which finishes dry and crisp.",Wente 2006 Riva Ranch Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)
"Dark, full and very oaky on the nose, this extracted Malbec is ripe and toasty smelling. Tannic, stacked and chewy in the mouth, with flavors of roasted blackberry, raw oak, chocolate and clove, this finishes with a ton of unabsorbed oak and related flavors of clove and mint.",Benvenuto de la Serna 2010 Malbec (Uco Valley)
"Spicy and juicy, this is obviously a wood-aged wine. It offers tannins, red fruits, coffee and a warm, rich character balanced by acidity that cuts through the structure. It needs some aging, so drink from 2016.",Herdade de São Miguel 2012 Atlântico Gold Label Reserva Red (Alentejano)
"Cedar, cinnamon and nutmeg notes show in the aromas and continue in the flavors. This complexity blends well with the classic Merlot flavors of black cherry and subtle herbs. It's medium to full bodied, but very smooth in texture. The blend is Merlot, Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.",Ironstone 2012 Obsession Red (Lodi)
"The first vintage from this estate vineyard, this is quite light, especially as the 2011 vintage was cool. It shows the delicate structure at which Pinot Noir excels. It's aromatic and varietal, very well made, and a good bottle for any roasted small bird such as squab or quail.",J Wrigley 2011 Proposal Block Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"Fresh and young, this offers scents of violets, plummy fruit and a wash of root beer. Lively in the mouth, it has a leesy minerality that underscores rather light, pretty, but simple fruit. Drink up while it retains its freshness.",J Wrigley 2012 Mac Cuvée Pinot Noir (McMinnville)
"This is a rich, full-bodied, medium-sweet wine full of generous fruits and ripe spice. There's no need to wait to drink this lively wine with its light touch of acidity at the end.",Kuentz-Bas 2013 Collection Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Kumeu River's entry-level Chardonnay is an easy introduction the house style, and perfect for high-end by-the-glass service. While it lacks the richness and toast of its stablemates, it delivers ample apple, pear and citrus flavors, gaining focus and displaying fine length.",Kumeu River 2012 Village Chardonnay (Kumeu)
"Bright and juicy, this straightforward, savory red delivers aromas and flavors of succulent blackberry, wild cherry, crushed raspberry and hints of cinnamon. Round, soft tannins give it an easy-drinking quality ideal for everyday occasions. Drink soon to capture the fresh fruit.",Marilena Barbera 2013 Nero d'Avola (Sicilia)
"A solid deal for the price, this blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc presents aromas of pine forest, damp caves and black cherry. The blueberry juice flavors fade fast, leaving black sage on the finish. The tannins are ready to drink now.",McClean 2010 Clemence Red (Paso Robles)
"This spent 18 months in neutral American oak, and has a strong woody scent and flavor. Light melon and cucumber fruit remains somewhat buried, and the mouthfeel is soft and diffuse. Drink up.",Merrill Cellars 2011 Reserve Viognier (Oregon)
"Grown at 1,800 feet in the dry upper Douro, this wine is full while retaining a cool, mineral edge. It was made entirely in tanks, giving primacy to the berry fruits and acidity. The tannins suggest it could age,  although it is very drinkable now.",Muxagat 2013 Tinta Barroca (Douro)
"Uncomplicated yet tasty, this medium-bodied, mild-textured wine has a pure raspberry/strawberry character from the bright aroma to the ripe flavors to the lingering finish. The balance is on the soft side due to low acidity and little astringency from tannins.",Navarro 2012 Zinfandel (Mendocino)
"Aromas of toasted oak, mint, vanilla and dried berry lead the nose and continue to the palate along with coffee and anise notes. It's rather austere and lacks fruit richness.",Nicosia 2011 Rosso  (Etna)
"Leesy mango and lime aromas are fleshy, but attractive. A plump, juicy palate is holding its own, while flavors of pithy orange and melon end in a friendly, round fashion.",Paramus 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)
"A bright, fresh example of Pinot Noir, this is medium bodied and slightly creamy in texture as well. Bold notes of red cherries and beet greens add hints of button mushroom on the palate, then finish tart and refreshing. Drink now–2016.",Lake Chalice 2012 Pinot Noir (Marlborough)
"While the nose shows sweet aromas of cherry bubblegum and vanilla, the palate brings notes of ripe cherry and currant balanced by zippy acidity. Soft tannins provide just enough grip, giving this fun and fruity wine adequate structure.",Winery at La Grange 2012 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Virginia)
"Slightly reduced aromas of red and black fruits are rustic and come with a whiff of animal hide. This Malbec-led blend is a touch shallow in feel, with candied berry flavors that suggest wild herbs and garrigue. A light, jumpy, fruity finish eschews weight for freshness.",Zuccardi 2011 Brazos de los Andes Red (Mendoza)
"While the nose is demure, suggesting only a hint of muted apple and pear, the sweet-tart palate on this spry wine is full of yellow-cherry flavor. Bracing acidity wraps the finish up tight and brisk.",Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2013 Goldtröpfchen Spätlese Riesling (Mosel)
"Clean, simple and fresh on the nose, this is showing aromas of lime and apple cider. The palate is creamy and melony more than sharp and acidic, with leesy pear and apple flavors that finish short but bright. Drink now.",Shaya 2013 Arindo Verdejo (Rueda)
"A blend of Grillo, Catarratto and Inzolia, this vibrant wine opens with delicate aromas of white flower, tropical fruit and a hint of beeswax. On the palate, creamy white peach is energized by nectarine zest and crisp acidity.",Spadafora 2013 Don Pietro White (Terre Siciliane)
"Strawberry and raspberry fruit carry a nice touch of bright spice, notably saffron. Some 30% new French oak was used, and the wine expresses it with highlights of toasted coconut. The wine has medium concentration and length, and will benefit from aggressive aeration.",Stanton Vineyard 2012 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"Aromas suggest passion fruit, crushed tomato vine and cut grass. The palate offers juicy grapefruit, lemon-lime and mint alongside crisp acidity.",Tenuta Gorghi Tondi 2013 Kheirè Grillo (Sicilia)
"The nose isn't very expressive but the palate eventually reveals raw red berry, espresso, brimstone and grilled rosemary alongside astringent and rather drying tannins.",Terrazze dell'Etna 2009 Cirneco Rosso  (Etna)
"A hazelnut-infused dessert wine based upon Pinot Noir, it's raisined, slightly volatile and impressively nutty. It turns creamy in the mouth, with rich flavors of hazelnut, toffee plus a hint of dried leaves.",Treos NV Ternion Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)
"This wine is all spice and sweetness. If the sense of terroir is missing, it does offer ripe swathes of apricot and spiced pear flavors lathered with honey. Drink now.",Wunsch & Mann 2012 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Aromas of smoke, bacon, mature black-skinned fruit and allspice waft out of the glass. The aromas follow through to the dense, monolithic palate, along with oak extract, vanilla, and a confectionary note.",Alessandro di Camporeale 2011 Kaid Syrah (Sicilia)
"Made with Nero d'Avola grapes that were partially left to wither on the vine, this offers aromas of fig, date, prune and vanilla. The soft, one-dimensional palate doles out ripe blackberry, mocha and a confectionary note alongside smooth, round tannins.",Barone Montalto 2013 Appassimento Nero d'Avola (Terre Siciliane)
"This warm, ripe wine has a balance between spice, rich fruit and a fresher background. It has enough spice to make it completely typical Gewurztraminer while keeping style and elegance. Drink now.",Cave de Beblenheim 2013 Réserve Particulière Gewurztraminer (Alsace)
"Made in a firm, dry style that will appeal to Cabernet drinkers, this smells like black cherries and blackberries and tastes full and fruity. It feels moderately tannic, well-balanced, and lingers a bit on the finish.",Chloe 2012 Red No. 249 Red (North Coast)
"Subdued aromas of Spanish broom and brimstone float from the glass. The vertical palate offers yellow apple, citrus zest and mineral alongside crisp acidity.",Contrada Santo Spirito di Passopisciaro 2012 Animalucente Bianco  (Etna)
"Mostly Lemberger, from a 1979 planting, this is an explosion of sweet berry and milk chocolate—what's not to like? Luscious and full across the palate, it's a raspberry truffle in a bottle. Not sweet, so not for dessert, but in a way it is dessert all by itself.",Kana 2006 Old Vines Red (Yakima Valley)
"Smooth, tropical and pure on the nose, with pineapple as the lead fruit. The palate is solid and full-bodied, with pineapple, papaya, honey and toasted flavors. Not “oaky” but it is well oaked, and thus the finish is warm, toasty and creamy. Drink now.",Lapostolle 2008 Cuvée Alexandre Atalayas Vineyard Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley)
"Very good Carmenère with requisite tea, herbal and bold berry aromas. The palate is just right in that it's neither heavy nor sharp, and the flavors of cola, burnt brown sugar and roasted berries are smooth and deep. Finishes with notes of coffee, herbs and sweet fruits as it hits the target close to the bull's eye.",Viña Bisquertt 2007 Ecos de Rulo Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Here's a plush, modern and thickly extracted Barbera d'Asti Superiore with a polished bouquet and well-dosed aromas of cherry, blackberry, spice, chocolate and tobacco. The wine is drying and crisp at the same time with polished tannins on the close.",Vinchio-Vaglio Serra 2007 Vigne Vecchie  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Good price for a dry, lusty Malbec that shows the variety's huge fruit, in a balanced, elegant package. While it's very tannic, the wine is softly drinkable now for its vast wealth of blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate, anise and sandalwood flavors.",McDermaid 2007 McDermaid Family Vineyard Malbec (Red Hills Lake County)
"Smells good and true, with dry spice and catchy red-fruit aromas. The palate is solid but not at all heavy, with lively red berry and exotic spice flavors. Lengthy and pure through the long finish, and overall this is the best Montes Pinot we've come across and also one of the best from Chile.",Montes 2009 Limited Selection Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)
"Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt plies his trade mainly in California, but this effort from his native country is a winner, featuring a lush mix of nectarine, melon and tomato leaf that finishes long and harmoniously.",Nick Goldschmidt 2008 Boulder Bank Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Among St. Clair's 2009 range of block Savvies, this is among the sweatiest, with pungent nettle and almost-asparagus notes on the nose. Yet on the palate, the wine is full-bodied, round and concentrated, with nectarine and honey elements punched up by bright herbal tones. Long and intense on the finish. Drink now.",Saint Clair 2009 Pioneer Block 20 Cash Block Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Sidewood's 2009 Chardonnay is a throwback to the sort of delicious, well-priced Chardonnays Australia used to be known for, but with a touch more class. It delivers a big blast of upfront melon and peach fruit nestled in toasted cashew-like oak, then finishes fresh and citrusy. Good value for drinking over the next 6–12 months.",Sidewood 2009 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)
"A strong, smoky set of aromas gets this going in the proper direction. There's also spice, earth, herbal aromas and leather to give it variety. The palate is deep and big, with blackberry, smoked meat and richness. Smooth on the finish, with black olive and additional herbal accents.",Arboleda 2008 Carmenère (Colchagua Valley)
"Here's a sweet and luscious Barbera d'Alba with bright, thick concentration and immediate aromas of blackberry, cassis and cherry. There is an obvious wood element here that adds tones of spice, vanilla and tobacco. The high density and richness of the wine leaves purplish glycerin trails on the side of the glass.",Cascina Ballarin 2007 Giuli  (Barbera d'Alba)
"Thick, black and extracted, this dense Barbera d'Asti Superiore opens with intense aromas of black fruit and fresh oak. Definitely give this wine at least two more years in the bottle for those smoky wood notes to find balance. At this young stage, the wine tastes new, chewy and raw.",Castello di Razzano 2007 Del Beneficio  (Barbera d'Asti Superiore)
"Pretty coffee notes are offset by ripe aromas of raspberry, black cherry and chocolate: There is nice softness and density in this wine that is balanced against the natural acidity of the fruit. Pair this wine with cheesy pasta al forno.",Marchesi Alfieri 2007 La Tota  (Barbera d'Asti)
"Pretty sharp in tannins and acids, even for a Stags Leap Cab. Although it has plenty of blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, it's a hard wine. The palate finds so much to like, it wants it to be softer, but it's not, so the gamble is on aging. Try after 2013.",Martin Ray 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District)
"Dark, tannic and toasty, it's a rich mouthful of wine. The fruit is moderately ripe, with light berry flavors; but the toast and chocolate and coffee barrel flavors add a lot of weight and punch. Nice winemaking from Gordy Hill turns out a delicious wine.",Milbrandt 2006 The Estates Merlot (Wahluke Slope)
"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",Papapietro Perry 2007 Pauline's Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)
"Perhaps this just needs some additional time for the Cabernet and Shiraz components to meld, because right now it comes across as slightly chunky and warm, with cassis and plum flavors verging on prune, yet nicely framed by vanilla and cedar. Try 2012–2020, although this wine has a track record that suggests longer aging isn't out of the question.",Penfolds 2006 Bin 389 Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa)
"A soft, easygoing style of Marlborough Sauvignon, the 2009 Ponga exhibits ripe, almost honeyed, stone-fruit aromas that slide easily into melon and nectarine flavors marked by only a touch of grassiness.",Ponga 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)
"Comes from a little-understood part of the sprawling Sonoma Coast, a place near San Pablo Bay yet to prove itself. There are ripe, rich, young vine flavors of cherry pie and cola, with a very sharp bite of tartness. Think of opulence versus acidity. Hard to tell which side wins. Drink now, for fresh, jammy fruitiness.",Roessler 2008 Griffin's Lair Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)
"Smoky and savory, with sharp acidity under black cherry fruit. It's still pulling itself together, but the weight and balance are there, showing hints of tobacco leaf, mint and herb.",Seven Hills 2007 Tempranillo (Columbia Valley (WA))
"The style at Domaines Ott has changed to become fresher and less oxidative, and the wine fits the new look. It is vivid, crisp, a rich texture giving fresh berry fruit and a light layer of acidity.",Domaines Ott 2009 Château de Selle Rosé (Côtes de Provence)
"It's interesting and a little odd that this 100% Sauvignon Blanc, from Mondavi's heralded To Kalon's great I Block, already is showing signs of maturity, although it's only about three years old. The reserve To Kalon, released more than a year ago, was fresh and fruity. This wine by contrast is beginning to show mushroom, herb and mineral complexities alongside the citrus fruits. It's a very fine wine, superior in structural integrity and bone dry, but it will separate wine lovers into opposing camps.",Robert Mondavi 2010 To Kalon Vineyard I Block Fumé Blanc (Oakville)
"As befits a single vineyard Gevrey Chambertin, this is a structured wine, firmly rooted in tannins. Hidden beneath are black plum and cherry flavors that are raring to go—rich and sumptuous. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2016.",Henri de Villamont 2010 Les Evocelles  (Gevrey-Chambertin)
"This is a smooth, ripe, and rounded wine that's intense on the palate with bright red-fruit flavors. Integrated acidity and hints of maturity add balance to rich fruitiness. Reserve wines blended into the Champagne lend a fullness to the palate that makes the wine ready to drink now.",Henriet-Bazin NV Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru Brut Pinot Noir (Champagne)
"A bold, powerful wine, showing smooth, mature black-fruit flavors and rich tannins. It is soft, solid and powerfully built. Wood aging has given extra roundness and a touch of spice to the palate. Drink this wine now and until 2018.",Herdade dos Machados 2007 Reserva Red (Alentejo)
"Here's a lovely sparkling wine that offers a floral fragrance of white flowers and tropical fruit. The palate delivers apple, white peach and a hint of almond. It has a creamy texture and a clean, crisp finish. A classic Franciacorta.",Il Mosnel NV Brut Sparkling (Franciacorta)
"This vibrantly aromatic wine brings generous notes of honey, pineapple, papaya and apricot. It's intensely sweet and rich in flavor and feel, lingering on the finish.",Inniskillin 2011 Icewine Vidal (Niagara Peninsula)
"A crisp, finely balanced wine, this is packed with fresh citrus, peach-skin and green-apple flavors. It's a textured wine with layers of minerality on the palate. The acidity is just right—a fine streak that cuts through the fruitiness and gives a tight, taut finish.",J. Dumangin Fils NV La Cuvée 17 Brut  (Champagne)
"Full-throttle Burgundian technique marks this Chardonnay. It's explosive with buttered toast and popcorn and apricot and orange jam flavors. There's a fine streak of lime acidity. It's an exciting wine, as opulent as California Chard gets, if a little over-the-top, venturing beyond balance into opulence for its own sake.",Jarvis 2011 Finch Hollow Estate Grown Cave Fermented Chardonnay (Napa Valley)
"While full and ripe in style, this wine is also quite dry. It's packed with crisp, youthful fruits, along with an intensely mineral texture that penetrates deep on the palate. Apple and lime juice pierce through the finish. Drink through 2021.",Nicolas Feuillatte 2005 Cuvée Spéciale Brut Millesimé  (Champagne)
"This is a deliciously fruity, yet structured wine. It has weight and richness, but mainains elegance with lemony acidity, ripe grapefruit flavor, and layered wood notes. It's a wine for long-term aging so drink from 2015.",Pascal Bouchard 2011 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis)
"This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017.",Bouchard Aîné & Fils 2011 Cuvée Signature  (Clos de la Roche)
"A ripe and fruity wine that boasts yellow fruits and fresh citrus characteristics. It's lush and ripe, with just a touch of minerality to give the wine structure. There's a delicious tangy aftertaste to this full, impressive wine.",Casa da Passarella 2012 O Oenólgo Encruzado (Dão)
